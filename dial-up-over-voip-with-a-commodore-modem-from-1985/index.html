</p>


  

<p>I connected a pair of computers with a 300 bits/s point-to-point dial-up
network through a pair of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) phone lines. This type of
networking predates commercial dial-up internet, and required users to directly
call the specific online service they wished to connect to, such as CompuServe
or a bulletin board system. Nowadays there’s little practical benefit to
dial-up networking. It’s also become more difficult over time because telcos
have started digitizing landlines employing codecs and audio filtering
optimized for voice that can interfere with the tones that dial-up modems use
to communicate. VoIP phone lines have been known to suffer from similar issues,
but at least give users some amount of control over how the signal is digitized.</p>
<p>Despite this I thought it would be really cool to connect my Commodore 64 to
some dial-up BBSes, but there don’t seem to be any left in Australia.
So then I thought it would be even cooler to run my own.
I’m not at that point yet, but getting two computers to communicate with each
other at all was very involved so I’m documenting what I’ve found out so far
before going further. Two months ago I’d never heard of an ATA or
Hayes-compatible modem so telephony-wise I was really starting from scratch. This
post is aimed at me two months ago and anyone else curious about going online
like it’s 1985 but aren’t sure how to start.</p>
<p>Here’s my setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/setup.jpg" alt="Desk with a pair of computers. On the left is a Commodore 64 and on the right is a PC. Between them is an analog telephone adapter and dial-up modem" /></p>
<p>On the left is a Commodore 64 with a Commodore 300 Modem attached.
On the right is a regular PC running Linux. In between, the beige box
is a dial-up modem connected to the PC’s serial port, and the black
box is an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which converts analog telephone
signals to VoIP. Both modems are attached to the ATA with phone cables.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram showing all the devices involved and how they’re connected to each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/topology.jpg" alt="Topology of dial-up setup" /></p>
<p>I can call the PC’s modem from the Commodore 64 and answer the call on the PC side.
The modems handshake with a variant of the iconic “dial-up modem” sound.
Then they are connected, and when I type
on the Commodore the text appears on the PC’s terminal and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="dial-up-mental-model"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#dial-up-mental-model" aria-label="Anchor link for: dial-up-mental-model">Dial-up Mental Model</a></h2>
<p>Each computer is connected to
a modem via a serial interface. There’s a wire for sending data and a separate wire for
receiving data, plus some additional wires for control signals and ground.
At any point in time, each data wire can either be a (relatively) high voltage (e.g. 5v) representing a binary 1
or a low voltage (e.g. 0v) representing 0, and the sender sends a single bit at a time by setting
the voltage of the sending wire. There is no clock signal, so both the computer and modem
must agree on the bit rate to effectively interpret each other’s signals.
There’s no out of band way to indicate that data is currently being sent.
Instead, the neutral state of a data wire is high voltage, and data is sent in blocks of (usually 8) bits
preceded by a single 0 bit called the “start bit”, and followed by one or two 1 bits called “stop bits”,
and the wire is left at high voltage until the next start bit.
To send a character over serial, such as when you press a key on your keyboard attached to a serial terminal,
the character is numerically encoded (e.g. with ASCII) and the encoded value is sent least-significant-bit-first
wrapped in start and stop bits. When data is received by the serial port, the terminal decodes the value
and prints the character it represents.</p>
<p>Many dial-up modems implement a set of commands known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set">Hayes AT command
set</a>, where the text of
commands and their responses are sent over the serial interface between the
computer and modem. These commands can be used to configure the modem or take actions such as
dialing a number or answering a call.
I mention this here as an example of the computer communicating with the modem directly rather than as
a conduit to connect with a remote computer.</p>
<p>When one modem is connected to another modem through the phone network, data received by a modem from
its local computer is sent over the phone line by modulating the frequency of a “carrier signal”, a method
known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying">Frequency-shift Keying (FSK)</a>.
If you could listen to the analog signal sent or received over the phone line by a modem you would hear a faint
tone in the order of 1 to 2 kHz. This is the carrier signal.
Both modems generate a carrier signal which they modulate to send data to the other modem.
The specific way the carrier signal is
modulated depends on the speed of the connection between the modems. In my setup they send 300 bits/s
using a protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103">Bell 103</a>, where the initial carrier
signal represents 1, and its pitch shifted down by ~200Hz to send a 0.</p>
<p>Here’s a recording I took of the audio received by one of my modems over the phone line while some
data was being transmitted. The X-axis is time and the Y-axis is pitch, and the pitches representing
a 0 and 1 are clearly visible.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/modem-recording.jpg" alt="A horizontal green line varying between two different heights, visualizing a binary signal" /></p>
<p>As with a serial interface
there is no clock signal, so both modems have to agree on a bit rate.
There are multiple different FSK modem protocols, and each prescribes the carrier frequencies
and their modulation, and the speed of the connection. The modems negotiate which protocol they
will use during the modem handshake when a phone call between modems initially connects.</p>
<p>If analog landlines were still common the above explanation would be sufficient,
but to connect two modems over the phone network in 2026 you’re probably going to
need to do so over the internet using VoIP. To use an analog device like a modem or analog phone
you’ll need an analog telephone adapter (ATA), which is a device with phone jacks and usually
an Ethernet port so it can connect to the internet via your router. You’ll also need to make
an account with a VoIP provider and rent some phone numbers from them, and configure your ATA
so that each phone number is associated with one of its phone jacks. You’ll also need to disable
echo cancellation in your ATA’s settings or it messes with the modem signals.</p>
<h2 id="analog-telephone-adapter-ata"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#analog-telephone-adapter-ata" aria-label="Anchor link for: analog-telephone-adapter-ata">Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA)</a></h2>
<p>An ATA is a device which converts analog phone signals to VoIP.
I’m using a Grandstream HT802 v2 as my ATA which has two telephone ports
allowing me to plug in both modems. I made an account with a VoIP provider
(Crazytel), set up two SIPs, each with their own associated phone number, and
then registered one SIP for each port of the ATA via its web interface.</p>
<p>Dial-up networking over VoIP requires as raw a signal as possible being sent between the modems.
Make sure the first choice of codec is PCMU, also known as G.711, which is the highest quality
codec available on most ATAs. Also make sure any echo or silence suppression provided by the ATA
is disabled. Enable jitter buffering (it’s probably enabled by default). I found it’s most reliable
to use the maximum amount of jitter buffering available on the ATA.</p>
<p>Test the ATA setup by making calls between each VoIP phone number and your mobile phone by plugging
an analog phone into each port on the ATA.</p>
<h2 id="pc-and-dial-up-modem"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#pc-and-dial-up-modem" aria-label="Anchor link for: pc-and-dial-up-modem">PC and dial-up modem</a></h2>
<p>My modem is a NetComm Roadster II 56 Ultra SVD. There’s not much information about it online and I
wasn’t able to dig up a manual, but there are some photos <a href="https://wiki.preterhuman.net/NetComm_Roadster_II_56_Ultra_SVD">here</a> and it’s also mentioned <a href="https://goughlui.com/2012/11/27/tech-flashback-other-external-modems-in-my-collection/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here it is. The lights on the front are labeled: Power, Terminal Ready, Off Hook, Carrier Detect, Data.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/netcomm-modem-iso.jpg" alt="Netcomm Roadster II 56 Ultra modem, isometric view" /></p>
<p>Here’s the back. The “Data” port is how it connects to the PC.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/netcomm-modem-back.jpg" alt="Netcomm Roadster II 56 Ultra modem, rear view showing jacks: Power, Data, Phone, Line" /></p>
<p>You’ll need a DB9 male to female serial cable like this one to connect it to a PC:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/serial-cable.jpg" alt="The ends of a DB9 M/F serial cable" /></p>
<p>I was lucky enough to find a computer abandoned under a bridge which is old enough to still have a
DB9 port but new enough to run a modern OS. Most computers from the past decade or so don’t have this port
but it should be easy to find a USB to DB9 adapter.</p>
<p>To interact with the modem from the PC you’ll need terminal software that can send and receive data
over a serial port. On Linux I usually use <code>picocom</code>. Once everything is connected and powered on, run
<code>picocom /dev/ttyS0</code> from a terminal.
This should cause the “Terminal Ready” light on the modem to light up.
If it doesn’t, your serial cable is bad, and while you’ll still be able to interact with the modem directly
over serial port, you won’t be able to send or receive any data from the remote side once a connection is
established. Ask me how I know.</p>
<p>Typing in a picocom session sends characters over the serial connection.
Eventually we’ll use this to send characters all the way to the Commodore 64 via the dial-up network, but
for now the characters will be interpreted by the modem, which implements the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set">Hayes AT command set</a>.
These are commands for configuring a modem or performing actions such as
dialing a number or answering a call.</p>
<p>To test that the modem is working, try typing <code>AT</code> (then hit enter), to which the modem should reply <code>OK</code>.
Test that the modem can receive calls by connecting it to one of the ATA’s phone ports with a phone cable
and then calling number associated with that port (with your mobile phone).
When I do this the modem sends the word <code>RING</code> over the serial connection. The
command to answer a call is <code>ATA</code> (it’s a coincidence that this is the name for
the device for connecting analog devices to VoIP). The modem will probably send
some beeps over the phone connection then give up when it doesn’t receive a
carrier signal. The command to end a call is <code>ATH</code>. It’s not directly relevant to this setup,
but you can also dial a number from the modem with the command <code>ATDT</code> followed by the number.</p>

<p>Here’s my Commodore 64:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/c64-top.jpg" alt="Commodore 64 top view showing RCA adapter and SD2IEC peripherals" /></p>
<p>I’m using a <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SD2IEC">SD2IEC</a> device (the black
box at the top right) to run programs from an SD card.</p>
<p>The Commodore Modem slots into the Commodore 64’s user port. Here’s the modem:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/commodore-modem-front.jpg" alt="Commodore Modem 300 front view showing user port connector" /></p>
<p>This modem doesn’t have built-in support for generating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTMF_signaling">DTMF touch tones</a> to dial a number.
Instead, there’s an “Audio In” RCA jack on the back which you can play touch tones into.
The intended usage was to connect the audio signal coming out of the Commodore 64 itself
to this jack and then use the Commodore 64’s sound chip to generate touch tones.
The terminal software I’m using on the Commodore doesn’t have support for generating these tones
however.</p>
<p>Instead, I found two ways to initialize a call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate touch tones on a laptop or mobile phone, with its headphone jack
attached to the modem’s “Audio In” with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter (using either
the red or white RCA cable - it doesn’t matter which). I used
<a href="https://apkpure.com/dtmf-tone-generator-decoder/com.arcoirislabs.dtmfencdec.app">this</a>
android app to generate the tones.</li>
<li>Plug an analog phone into the “Phone” jack on the back of the modem, and use the phone to initialize the call.
Then use terminal software on the Commodore 64 to have the modem take over the call before the other side picks up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about initiating a call <a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/#initiating-a-call">below</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the back of the modem showing the “Audio In” and “Phone” jacks, as well as the “Line” jack which will be used to connect the modem to the ATA.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/commodore-modem-back.jpg" alt="Commodore Modem 300 rear view showing Audio In, Phone, and Line jacks" /></p>
<p>Also in the above image are the two phone jacks. Connect the one marked “Line” to the ATA, and plug an analog
phone into the one marked “Phone”. The “Phone” jack is probably so that households with a single landline could
share it between the modem and phone without needing to physically unplug the phone and plug in the modem every
time they wanted to use the modem. In this setup the analog phone is used for initializing a call to the PC’s modem,
and also for resetting the modem at the end of a call.</p>
<p>The modem has a built-in speaker which lets you hear the dial tone and other phone noises to understand
what state the line is in. Unfortunately it’s really loud and of poor quality, and there’s no way to turn
it down or off. After a day of this I decided to make some modifications and added this headphone jack
to the side, and now I can plug in a speaker with a volume knob. The audio
quality was also dramatically improved. This headphone jack also makes it possible to record the raw
audio signal received by the modem, which I wasn’t able to do before.</p>

<p>The terminal program I’m using on the Commodore is <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Novaterm">Novaterm</a>
which I’m loading off an SD card with the SD2IEC device.
Here’s the main menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/novaterm1.jpg" alt="Main menu of Novaterm program" /></p>
<p>The configuration to make Novaterm work with the Commodore modem is below.
On the first configuration page, the <code>Modem type</code> must be set to <code>1660</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/novaterm2.jpg" alt="First configuration page of Novaterm program" /></p>
<p>On the second configuration page, the <code>Serial driver</code> must be <code>User port</code>.
Also enable <code>Print in ASCII</code> since the Linux side of the connection will assume text is ASCII-encoded.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/novaterm3.jpg" alt="Second configuration page of Novaterm program" /></p>
<p>Once Novaterm is configured you can save the configuration to the SD card, then
enter the terminal by selecting <code>Terminal mode</code> from the main menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/novaterm4.jpg" alt="Terminal mode of Novaterm program" /></p>
<p>This is the screen where data can be sent and received via the modem once it’s connected.
There’s a few other operations we can do from here. Press <code>C= M</code> for a list:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/novaterm-help.jpg" alt="List of commands for the Notaterm terminal" /></p>
<p>Relevant for us are <code>C= H</code> and <code>C= J</code> which are described as “Hang up phone” and “Phone off hook” respectively.
Oddly I found that these commands did the opposite of what they say. When I press <code>C= H</code> I hear a dial tone
from the modem (from the speakers attached to its aftermarket headphone jack), and the attached analog phone powers off.
When the modem is in this state, playing the touch tones to dial a number into the “Audio In” port initiates a call.
Pressing <code>C= J</code> ends the current call and causes the analog phone to turn back on. Sometimes <code>C= J</code>
also causes a hissing static sound to start from the inside the modem. It’s not played through the speakers (nor the internal speaker which I disconnected).
The hissing can be stopped by picking up the handset of the analog phone.</p>
<h3 id="initiating-a-call"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#initiating-a-call" aria-label="Anchor link for: initiating-a-call">Initiating a Call</a></h3>
<p>As described above there are two ways to start a call:</p>
<h4 id="external-device"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#external-device" aria-label="Anchor link for: external-device">External Device</a></h4>
<p>To initiate a call by playing touch tones into the “Audio In” jack, attach the device that will generate the tones with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter.
These adapters usually have two RCA plugs for the left and right audio channel, so just connect one of the plugs to the modem and let the other dangle.
Press <code>C= H</code> on the modem and you should hear a dial tone through the modem or its speakers.
Then play the touch tones for the number you want to dial. I found that 100ms tones with 50ms gaps works, but the timing may depend on your ATA.
You should hear the touch tones play out of the modem’s speakers, and as soon as the first touch tone plays the dial tone should stop.
If the dial tone persists throughout the touch tones and the call doesn’t connect, try increasing the volume of the device generating the touch tones.
A few seconds after the final touch tone played, you should hear a ring tone through the modem’s speakers.</p>
<h4 id="analog-phone"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#analog-phone" aria-label="Anchor link for: analog-phone">Analog Phone</a></h4>
<p>To initiate a call with the analog phone, press <code>C= J</code> to make sure the phone is powered on.
Pick up the phone, and you should hear a dial tone through the receiver (it’s just a regular phone at this point).
Dial the number you want to call, and wait until you hear a ring tone through the receiver.
Without hanging up the phone, press <code>C= H</code> on the Commodore. The analog phone will immediately go dead,
and you should now hear the ring tone play through the modem (or attached
speakers).</p>
<h2 id="connecting"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#connecting" aria-label="Anchor link for: connecting">Connecting</a></h2>
<p>We’re finally ready to go online.</p>
<p>Start a terminal (e.g. <code>picocom</code>) session on the PC, and make sure the modem is
alive by sending <code>AT</code> and getting a response <code>OK</code>, and make sure the “Terminal
Ready” light on the modem is on.</p>
<p>The Commodore and PC modems should be attached to the two phone ports of the ATA.
Note down which VoIP phone number is associated with each of the ports.
Then from the Commodore side, <a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/dial-up-over-voip-with-a-commodore-modem-from-1985/#initiating-a-call">initiate a call</a>, dialing the number associated with the port which the PC’s modem is plugged into.
The terminal on the PC should periodically print <code>RING</code> indicating an incoming call.
Send the command <code>ATA</code> to the modem to answer the call.</p>
<p>Now the modems should handshake, indicated by some loud beeping from both. When
the beeping stops, the PC’s modem should print <code>CONNECT</code> to the terminal, and
on the top status line in Novaterm on the Commodore, the <code>C</code> should light up
and the timer should start incrementing.</p>
<p>Finally, on the PC side, adjust the baud rate to 300. Above I explained that both sides of a serial or modem connection must agree on the bit rate.
I initially assumed that the connection between both modems and the connection between the PC’s modem and the PC could operate at different rates,
as long as the digital side of the modem matched the PC’s serial port bit rate, and the analog side of the modem matched the other modem’s bit rate.
I expected the PC’s modem would buffer data from the PC at one rate, and transmit it at a different rate over the phone line.
Maybe other modems work this way, but mine does not, and I found that out the hard way. The Commodore modem always operates at 300 bits/s, so the PC’s
serial port must be configured to the same speed. If you’re using <code>picocom</code>, you can change the baud rate with <code>C-a C-b</code> which will prompt for a new rate,
or you can start a <code>picocom</code> session with
<code>picocom -b 300 /dev/ttyS0</code>. The digital side of the modem will adjust its rate to match the rate of the PC’s serial port, which it can figure out dynamically because
it knows all commands will begin with a fixed sequence of bits making up the command prefix <code>AT</code>.</p>
<p>And now you’re connected! Typing into the <code>picocom</code> terminal will send characters to the Commodore and vice versa.</p>
<p>Here’s how the entire process looks on the Commodore side including the modem sounds. Note the spurious character received by the Commodore immediately after it connects.</p>

<p>The Linux PC side can interact with the remote side by redirecting IO to/from <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>. Keep the serial terminal running
to maintain the connection, and in a separate terminal run something like <code>echo Hello, World! &gt; /dev/ttyS0</code> to send the text to the remote machine.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the reasons this didn’t work the first time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugging my ATA into my home network on the far side of a wireless bridge causes my internet to go down intermittently. The room where I keep my Commodore
is at the opposite end of my apartment to my router, and I don’t want to run an Ethernet cable to connect them. I was using an old router with WDS to connect
the Ethernet network in the room with the Commodore to the WIFI network from my main router. The ATA worked fine when plugged into my main router, but when
plugged into the far side of the WDS bridge it would cause my main router to lose connection with my ISP for a few minutes every hour or so. After days of
investigating I still don’t know why this happened, but I fixed the issue by installing a dedicated WIFI bridge instead of using WDS.</li>
<li>The Commodore modem can’t generate touch tones. It can still theoretically dial numbers using pulse dialing - the style of dialing used by rotary phones.
My ATA can be configured to allow pulse dialing, but I still couldn’t make it work. I spent a while trying to find a Commodore terminal which also supported
generating touch tones on the sound chip, and connecting the Commodore’s audio out to the modem’s audio in, but it still wouldn’t initiate a call, possibly because
of the quality or volume of the touch tones. Only then did I experiment with using an external device to generate the tones, which worked.</li>
<li>The NetComm modem only handshakes when its baud rate is set to “auto”. The Hayes AT commands let you change the baud rate of the modem, and I thought
I could rule out an incorrect baud rate as the problem by forcing it to use 300 baud. Running <code>ATS37=1</code> forces 300 baud, but the consequence was it would no longer
handshake with the Commodore modem, despite the latter running at 300 baud. Changing the NetComm modem’s baud to auto mode (<code>ATS37=0</code>) allowed the
handshake to complete. Auto mode is the default setting, and I observed it could handshake before I changed it, but not reliably (due to other issues)
so I changed it. Only upon changing it back was the modem able to handshake.</li>
<li>I bought the wrong 2 port ATA. I was originally using a 1 port ATA for the Commodore side, and my router’s built-in ATA for the PC side. It wasn’t working
due to all the other reasons on this list, so I decided to buy a 2 port ATA of the same model as a video I found with a similar setup to mine to rule out
the ATA as the problem. I bought a second-hand Cisco ATA 191 without realizing that there are two models of the ATA 191 - a multiplatform model
which allows configuration through a web UI - and an enterprise model which is locked down. And I bought the wrong one.</li>
<li>My serial cable was apparently faulty, as the “Terminal Ready” light on the modem didn’t turn on at first. The symptom was that I could send commands
to the modem, and even have it handshake, but the PC couldn’t send or receive any data via the modem. Fortunately I had a spare which worked.</li>
<li>I didn’t realize the PC’s serial port needs to match the baud rate of the connection between the two modems. I assumed I could use a faster baud rate
when sending data from the PC to the modem, and the modem would buffer the data and send data to the other modem at a slower speed. Surely some
modems must work like this, otherwise the servers providing dial-up services would need to constantly adjust their baud rates to match the caller’s
modems, and the Hayes AT commands don’t provide a way to find out the current baud rate of the analog side of the modem.</li>
<li>On the Commodore side, I missed that you had to set the serial driver to “User port”. I’d already set the modem type to 1660, which refers to this
specific model of modem which can only be connected via the user port so I didn’t look for another setting about the interface between the computer and modem
at first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only after everything on that list was addressed was any data able to make it across the dial-up connection, however
everything I tried to send would be received garbled. Bytes received by the PC from the commodore were mostly made up of 1 bits, like <code>OxFF</code> and <code>OxFE</code>.
Data sent from the PC to the Commodore would be “spread out”, with each byte sent being received as 4 or 5 bytes. But at least there was a consistent mapping
from character sent to characters received. The problem turned out to be that I had disabled the jitter buffer on the ATA, following the principle of
“disable all the fancy ATA voice features”. It turns out this feature is important for preventing interruptions to the call caused by routing the call
over the internet. It adds latency but otherwise doesn’t affect the signal. Once I enabled the jitter buffer I could send and receive data over the dial-up network.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#next-steps" aria-label="Anchor link for: next-steps">Next Steps</a></h2>
<p>My eventual goal is to host a dial-up bulletin board system. I think this will require a different modem, as currently I need to change the PC’s
baud rate to match the dial-up connection in order to send data over it, and there’s no way to determine this automatically.</p>
<p>Looking around online
there doesn’t seem to be any maintained dial-up BBS software for Linux. I think my best bet will be to emulate an
old computer on the Linux machine and connect the serial port to the emulator, then find some BBS software for the emulated machine.</p>
