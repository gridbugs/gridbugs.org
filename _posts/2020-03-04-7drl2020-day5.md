Today I focused on upgrades. There are certain enemies which grant attack, defense, and
tech items when damaged. Upon completion of a level, this dialog appears letting you
choose an ability (abilities let you manipulate the sequences of items).

Tomorrow I need to play the game a ton and tweak mechanics until it is fun.
I have an idea for a final boss fight: A slime which divides when hit, into slimes with
random combinations of properties!
