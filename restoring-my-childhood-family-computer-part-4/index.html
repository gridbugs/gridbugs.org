<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/banner.jpg" alt="Close-up of the logo on the front of my Macintosh LC575" /></p>
<p>Wow has it really been over a year since I posted an update on this project?
In <a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-3/">Part 3</a> I
powered on the machine with the new motherboard. It played the Macintosh startup chime
followed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Chimes_of_Death">Chime of Death</a>
and did not boot.</p>
<p>Before continuing with repairing the hardware I wanted to try taking an image of the hard drive
in case I made a mistake and damage it.</p>
<p>Here’s the drive:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/drive.jpg" alt="The SCSI hard drive from my Macintosh" /></p>
<p>The drive has a SCSI port, so to attach it to a modern computer I needed an
adapter. The only adapter I could find on ebay was this PCI card:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/adapter.jpg" alt="SCSI interface on a PCI card" /></p>
<p>PCI is also quite an old connector and none of my computers had a PCI
slot. I went and bought and old-ish second-hand PC on ebay with a PCI
slot.</p>
<p>Then I chickened out and contacted a local data recovery company. I brought them
the drive and waited.</p>
<p>After not hearing back for a few weeks I called them and it turned out they
didn’t have the right adapter, so I lent them mine and waited again.</p>
<p>After about a month of delays I gave up waiting, took back my drive and adapter,
and attempted the recovery myself.</p>
<p>I verified that Linux could recognize the SCSI adapter in my second-hand
computer. I powered down the machine, attached the SCSI ribbon cable and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex_connector">Molex</a> power cable.</p>
<p>When I turned the machine back on the drive lit up with sparks and released some
purple smoke.</p>
<p>It left this faint shadow on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/burn-mark.jpg" alt="Desk surface with a faint outline of a drive in soot" /></p>
<p>I still don’t know what went wrong. I have a spare SCSI hard drive but I’m not
about to waste it by plugging it into a faulty adapter and destroying it too.
My best theory is that the drive was already damaged. The Macintosh had
been left outside in a tropical location for several years. It’s possible that
the drive’s PCB had rusted and when power was applied it shorted out or a
damaged part overheated. If this is the case then it’s odd that there were no
fireworks when I tried powering on the Macintosh with the hard drive still
attached, but maybe its power supply wasn’t powerful enough to do this sort of
damage? Perhaps that explains the strange noises I mentioned in the previous
post.</p>
<p>Once the smoke cleared it occurred to me that
while the drive’s PCB was fried, it’s possible that the disk inside was
undamaged. I contacted a second, better data recovery company, told them the story, and
brought them the drive. They had a bunch of working SCSI drive PCBs
and they could swap the dead one for a live one and attempt to recover
the data.</p>
<p>I committed to paying something like AUD $1000 <em>regardless of the outcome</em> (I
really wanted this data!) and nervously waited for several weeks.</p>
<p>In the end they were able to recover my data. Normally they make you pay for an
external hard drive with the recovered files on it but this is a 250mb hard
drive from 1994 so they just sent me a link to a google drive.</p>
<p>I loaded the disk image into the <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net">Basilisk II</a>
Macintosh emulator and:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/boot-error.png" alt="MacOS System 7 boot error with a “Restart” button" /></p>
<p>Honestly that is a better outcome than I was expecting. It’s kinda surreal that
a disk image from a real hard drive can just boot up in an emulator like this.</p>
<p>Clicking the “Restart” button in the error window just causes the window to
pop up again, so it seemed like the machine was stuck in a loop, but for some
reason I insisted on pressing “Restart” probably 100 times (sometimes with the shift key down,
sometimes without, not sure if it matters), and <em>eventually</em> the machine booted
successfully:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/boot-success.png" alt="MacOS System 7 desktop" /></p>
<p>And wow! I’m still amazed that this worked, and the data had just been sitting
on the disk for years. I’ve always associated this computer with my dad because
he was the main person who used it. He died when I was a kid and it was an
emotional moment seeing this machine running again, even if it’s just running virtually (for now!).</p>
<p>The “steve” file on the desktop is a Kings Quest 7 save
file but I’m not sure if it’s mine or my dad’s because his name was also Steve.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/macintosh-hd.png" alt="MacOS System 7 “Macintosh HD” folder" /></p>
<p>I remember the day when I learnt that you could colour-code icons and spent
hours traversing the filesystem, colouring everything.</p>
<p>Also what’s that “Bad Boy” file? It gave an error when opening and I didn’t
think much of it until I sat down to write this post, but more on that below.</p>
<p>Here’s our collection of games. Most of these are from a demo disk. More colour-coding evident here.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/games.png" alt="Games folder" /></p>
<p>Stephen’s various balloons in the above screenshot are save files from the
Fokker Triplane Flight Simulator, the game on the bottom-left of the box
pictured below:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/simulator-pack.jpg" alt="Mac Simulator Pack game box" /></p>
<p>Speaking of balloons, the question mark in a speech bubble at the top-right of
the screen enters “Balloon Help” mode where mousing over any entity displays an
explanation of that entity.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/help2.png" alt="Help bubble explaining the File menu" /></p>
<p>I’m tickled because it explains concepts that feel so obvious, but this was a
time when the visual language of a windowed operating system shell was
unfamiliar to most people.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/help1.png" alt="Help bubble explaining the Title bar" /></p>
<p>The help bubble is such a neat idea and it’s a shame it’s not common on
modern OSes. Searching a manual or the web requires naming the thing you want
help about, and how are users supposed to know it’s called a “Title bar”?</p>
<p>My dad used this computer for his work as a school teacher, and I was in his
grade 2 class. The disk had a bunch of my old creative writing assignments
on it. It also has assignments from all my classmates, which I won’t share here,
but if you were in Mr Sherratt’s grade 2 class in 1999 at Cardwell State School,
and want some of your old writing, get in touch (also hello, it’s been a
while!).</p>
<p>Here’s the first few pages of a story I found on the disk, written by me:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/lost-in-space0.png" alt="The cover of a short story titled “Lost in Space”" /></p>
<p>The font is called “Beginners Alphabet” and it’s always italicized. I
remember initially being taught to write with a slant so maybe it’s a good font
for children still learning to write. I’ve heard that the state government
prescribes fonts for use in schools.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/lost-in-space1.png" alt="The first page of the short story “Lost in Space”" /></p>
<p>I have a lot of nostalgia for this font. I’d completely forgotten about it but
it was everywhere at my school.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/desk-alphabet.png" alt="An alphabet of upper and lower case letters as commonly seen in classrooms" /></p>
<p>My dad must have printed out these labels to put around the classroom:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/labels1.png" alt="Some labels for objects in a classroom" /></p>
<p>We had Kid Pix!</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kid-pix.png" alt="The menu screen of Kid Pix" /></p>
<p>I remember designing this flying car in Kid Pix that would burn rubbish as fuel. Kinda
reminds of something from a movie I saw once…</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/flying-car.png" alt="Kid Pix screenshot with an image of a technical drawing of a flying car obviously made by a child (me!)" /></p>
<p>Speckled all over the filesystem were documents like this one. Oddly I don’t
remember actually owning a copy of Lemmings as a kid despite being obsessed with
playing it on the computers at school (though curiously the full version of
Lemmings is in the games folder). Lemmings doesn’t have save files; it just
prints a unique code for each level to type in the next time you play. I wrote a
bunch of these down on paper and must have typed them up at one point.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/lemmings-codes.png" alt="Document with a list of Lemmings level codes" /></p>
<p>I didn’t actually make it to the end of Lemmings until a few years ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/lemmings.png" alt="Lemmings gameplay" /></p>
<p>Here’s the “steve” file from the desktop loaded in Kings Quest 7. I (or
perhaps my dad?) was most of the way through (we completed it many times
though).</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kq7-bad-colour.png" alt="King’s Quest 7 with incorrect colours" /></p>
<p>The colours usually didn’t mess up like this on the real hardware.
Oddly enough, restarting the emulator with a higher resolution fixes the colours,
but now you have to play the game in a window.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kq7.png" alt="King’s Quest 7 with correct colours running in a window" /></p>
<p>To avoid the error loop on startup and to fix some other issues such as the sound not working, I made a fresh install of MacOS System 7 on a new virtual
drive and mounted the original disk image as a secondary drive. The “disk1” in the
above screenshot is the new boot disk. The “Unix” in the above screenshot
corresponds to a directory on the host machine and makes it possible to transfer
files between the virtual Macintosh and the real computer the emulator is
running on.</p>
<p>Ok so what was up with that “Bad Boy” file from earlier? It’s the file on the
left on the window below about halfway down.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/macintosh-hd.png" alt="MacOS System 7 “Macintosh HD” folder" /></p>
<p>Opening the file tries to launch HyperStudio but then it gives an error that the
file is not a stack:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/bad-boy-error1.png" alt="Error message that the file can’t be loaded because it’s not a stack" /></p>
<p>And then it takes you to this screen, asking to insert the “Kingfisher 101
Activities CD”.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/bad-boy-error2.png" alt="Message asking to insert a CD" /></p>
<p>Better do what it says.</p>
<p>The Kingfisher CD contains this program with several mini games.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher1.png" alt="A grid of mini games" /></p>
<p>The code game immediately caught my eye, and not for the first time.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher2.png" alt="A load game screen for a code mini game" /></p>
<p>Again this could have been my dad and not me. I have no memory of this game
but a secret code from either my dad or myself is a pretty neat find.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher3.png" alt="The code minigame with a secret message and a prompt for a 4 digit code" /></p>
<p>Now what was that code again?</p>
<p>I tried encrypting the alphabet to see if there’s an obvious pattern.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher4.png" alt="The code minigame, but this time it displays and upper and lower case alphabet" /></p>
<p>Every time you press the “Lock/Unlock” button the dog barks.</p>
<p>The 4 digit code turns out not to affect the result so the game must be just
storing it somewhere and applying the same transformation regardless of the
code.</p>
<p>The alphabets above map to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher5.png" alt="The code minigame with the encoded alphabet: MLKJIHGFEDCBA@?&gt;=&lt;;;987654 mlkjihgfedcba`_^]\[ZYXWVUT" /></p>
<p>There’s a pretty clear pattern. I started to suspect that re-encoding the secret
message would also decode it so I typed out the encoded message and then locked
it with an arbitrary key:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher6.png" alt="The code minigame with the message: Hello everybody. You have guessed my secret code!" /></p>
<p>What was I doing again?</p>
<p>Inspecting the raw contents of the “Bad Boy” file in a hex editor
didn’t reveal anything useful. I thought maybe opening it in a text
editor on the Macintosh might show some useful strings in whatever text encoding it
uses, but when I tried it displayed this:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/bad-boy.png" alt="MacOS System 7 desktop with a cartoon image of the face of a boy with green skin and his tongue poking out." /></p>
<p>I don’t understand how file types work on this machine. The OS knows (or at
least thinks it knows) what
program to launch when you double click a file but the files don’t have
extensions in their name. Somehow Finder believes this file file is a HyperStudio stack, and when
you try to open it in a text editor (TeachText) it correctly recognizes it as an
image and displays it in a window, but the current program is still TeachText.</p>
<p>TeachText appears to have been made by Apple so let’s see if the help bubble
has anything to say about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/help3.png" alt="The help bubble for TeachText explains that it can be used to display certain graphics" /></p>
<p>I freaking love help balloons.</p>
<p>So TeachText does know how display certain types of graphics!</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with HyperStudio or the Kingfisher 101 disk?</p>
<p>Well Kingfisher 101 is implemented as a HyperStudio stack. And take a look at the
“photofit” game. It’s icon looks a bit like our bad boy.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher1.png" alt="The Kingfisher 101 main menu. The photofit game has an icon that resembles the bad boy image" /></p>
<p>And running that game it’s clear how the bad boy image was created:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/kingfisher7.png" alt="The photofit game displays a face very similar to the bad boy image" /></p>
<p>So maybe the OS is keeping track of which program <em>created</em> each file, and it
runs that program when you double click the file? And in this case the file was
created by Kingfisher 101 (presumably by clicking the “save” button in the
screenshot above), but the file is just a regular image. So the OS recorded that
the image file was created by Kingfisher (or maybe HyperStudio?) and it’s
trying to open the file with that program rather than a program that knows how
to display images like TeachText.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/bad-boy-info.png" alt="The file info screen for the bad boy image where its kind is a HyperStudio document" /></p>
<p>Confusingly there doesn’t seem to be a way to change the kind of a file, so I
don’t know how to make it so that double-clicking on it will have it open in the
correct program.</p>
<p>I’ve spent many hours exploring this disk. It’s a fascinating look into the
history of computing as well as my own past. I found a large collection of my
dad’s old work and personal files which I’ve converted to google docs and shared
them with family members, and also put together a package with all the files
necessary to run our old Mac emulated on Windows, along with disk images for all
the games we used to play.</p>
<p>I feel like I was born at the perfect time for experiencing this sort of
nostalgia. In the 90s computers were powerful enough to support a wide range of
software accessible to most people, ubiquitous enough that you probably had one
in your home, but scarce enough that the family had to share. Users had to
figure out how to organize their files and software. Through their shared use machines
developed a kind of personality.</p>
<p>Computers were simple
enough to be easily emulated on modern hardware, and lacked security
features that might get in the way. And it’s worth going through the trouble to
experience that personality again.</p>
<p>Most desktop apps have been replaced with web apps
and physical media with app stores.
Nobody is forced to share a computer.
OSes abstract more of the details that most people find irrelevant.
Devices are locked down far beyond the point of protecting users.
Since the 90s computers have arguably improved at letting you do the things you want
to get done but I can’t shake the feeling that we’ve optimized away something
magical.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-4/mouse-practice-wave.png" alt="Mouse practice avatar waving" /></p>
<p>That’s all for now. The next step restoring the Macintosh will be trying to get
it working with my spare SCSI drive. I got my hands on some MacOS System 7 install
disks so barring additional hardware problems I’ll be able to install a fresh copy of MacOS.</p>
