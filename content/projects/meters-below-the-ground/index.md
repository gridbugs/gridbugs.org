Meters Below the Ground is a short tactical dungeon-crawler about escaping from
an insectoid-infested facility. Complete objectives to unlock more meters for
your character so you might stand a chance against the alien threat.

It is my entry in the 7 Day Roguelike game jam for 2018.

Play or download Meters Below the Ground in [its itch.io page](https://gridbugs.itch.io/meters-below-the-ground).
