# External Links

Here are some other places you can find me on the internet in addition to the links at the bottom of each page.

[Here](https://www.alicecaml.org)'s the website for my experimental OCaml build system Alice.

[Here](https://www.purpleearthhypothesis.com)'s a website going into more detail about my synthesizer projects.

I've given a few recorded talks at the Sydney Rust meetup:

- [Writing NES assembly programs in a Rust DSL](https://youtu.be/hs-MrEoOX5Y?t=0)
- [Making a roguelike in 7 days in Rust](https://youtu.be/RNjbgCsFtHA?t=0)
- [Escaping State-Machine Hell with a Pseudo-Synchronous DSL](https://youtu.be/ewNU9zYktBE?t=0)

Back when I worked on microkernels at CSIRO I wrote a blog post about debugging an interesting issue with some embedded C code: [Debugging Stories: Stack alignment matters](https://research.csiro.au/tsblog/debugging-stories-stack-alignment-matters/)

I also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gridbugstv) where I post synthesizer demos and some live coding.

When I was at university a million years ago I made a little website to teach myself web development and graphics by making javascript demos. Eventually I also started writing blog posts there and hand-rolled a static site generator which is a classic beginner mistake. Well the SSG is obviously long since broken but I kept a copy of the site and even though I'm mortally embarrassed of everything I've written over 5 years ago, I do keep the lights on at [stevebob.net](https://www.stevebob.net/).
