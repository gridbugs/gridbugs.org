# About

I'm Stephen Sherratt. I live in Sydney, Australia and I write software
for a living. I'm obsessed with modular synthesizers and technology from the 80s. Sometimes I make games. I cycle a lot, and enjoy camping and hiking, though I don't post much about that here.

For a long time my main hobby was roguelike development. I've entered
the [7 Day Roguelike](https://7drl.com/) every year since 2016. This
site started as a place for posting development logs for various game
projects. Nowadays I post about more general programming and
electronics projects I work on in my spare time.

For more things I've worked on outside of this site, see the [External Links](/external) page.

To contact me about this site, see the [Contact](/contact) page.
