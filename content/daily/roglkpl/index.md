Muscle memory is weird.

```rust
... => roglkpl!("{:?}", args), // rustc: cannot find macro `roglkpl` in this scope
```

`roglkpl` is what you get if you try to type `println` when someone changes your
keymap from dvorak to qwerty without you realising. Since starting to teach my
hands to type in qwerty about two weeks ago, I occasionally find myself lapsing
back into my old way of typing, and sometimes get a few words in before realising
that what I'm typing makes no sense. It still requires constant conscious effort
to type in qwerty, and a brief lapse in concentration can lead to...`roglkpl`.
