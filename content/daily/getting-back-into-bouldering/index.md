During the peak of covid in NSW I stopped bouldering.
Yesterday I climbed for the first time in about 3 months.
My muscle memory still remembers how to climb, but my muscles themselves,
unsurprisingly, are struggling, especially my forearms.
I also seem to tire much more quickly than before.
This will pass. I'm going to start climbing weekly.
