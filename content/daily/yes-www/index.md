Recently I changed the server config for this site such that
upon navigating to "gridbugs.org", you are forwarded to
"www.gridbugs.org". This was in response to reading
[www.yes-www.org](https://www.yes-www.org/why-use-www/)
which explains the technical (and societal!) benefits to serving web content
from a subdomain (such as "www" but it can of course, be anything),
rather than a naked domain (such as "gridbugs.org").

In the past I've used naked domains for my main sites, and
subdomains for spin-offs (such as my browser games at
[games.gridbugs.org](https://games.gridbugs.org).
I considered my reason for this and concluded that "it's because short URLs are sexy"
and upon realising this, promptly halted the practice.

Well sort of. It _is_ true that short URLs are sexy, but as long as web traffic
reaching the naked domain gets forwarded to the "www" (or whatever) subdomain,
you can still impress your friends with short URLs. They likely won't even notice
the sneaky "www." prepended to the domain name when they reach your site.
