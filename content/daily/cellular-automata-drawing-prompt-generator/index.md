While working on a totally unrelated project, I accidentally implemented a procedural
drawing prompt generator. The technique used to generate the images is a simple modification
to Conway's game of life. I've used this algorithm to generate caves for roguelikes in the
past. Here's an old post that explains how it works: [Cellular Automata Cave Generation](@/blog/cellular-automata-cave-generation/index.md).

Here's a link to the drawing prompt generator: [gridbugs.github.io/drawing-prompt](https://gridbugs.github.io/drawing-prompt/)
