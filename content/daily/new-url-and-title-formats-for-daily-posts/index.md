Today I updated the permalinks for these daily posts to be based on title of the post rather than the date.
The purpose is to make the URLs more meaningful.
When I write a post, I populate a new field which determines the permalink URL, and if
I forget it defaults to the date of the post.

I also removed the date from the heading and title of the pages that display the posts, displaying it under
the heading as I do for regular posts.
