Digging through an old hard drive I found a game I forgot I made.
This was in a time before every whimsical idea I had went into a
repo on github, and instead I would store repositories on a private
server. That server is gone now, and all that remains is the local
checkouts of projects on an almost forgotten hard disk.

So I salvaged what I could find, moving all the private repos onto
github, and added the [train game](https://games.gridbugs.org/train)
to games.gridbugs.org. It was my entry into the 2015 JS1K competition,
but it looks like I had to simplify the graphic of the train to get
the game (including graphics) to fit in under 1K.
