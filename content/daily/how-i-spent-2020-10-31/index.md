I'm going to start occasionally posting lists of non-technical things I did on particular days
to save time on days when I have nothing technical or insightful to share here.

Today I:
 - ate brunch at a cafe in Surry Hills
 - walked to Centennial Park to look at birds
 - got caught in a thunderstorm
 - watch a Halloween screening of a movie at a cinema in Newtown
 - played a one-shot table-top RPG created by a friend, that they were running for the first time
