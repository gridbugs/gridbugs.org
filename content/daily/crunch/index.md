My last few posts have been general because I haven't had time to make any
meaningful progress on personal projects due to spending almost
every waking hour at work. I work at a smallish autonomous vehicle startup
with a biggish board meeting next week and everyone is working frantically
to put together some cool demos.

Six months in at my first real startup, the most important lesson I've learnt
and put into practice is to not over engineer. I remember a time not so long
ago when I would take pride in building complex things. This job has taught
me the value of simplicity - of building the most basic, stupid version of
the thing you need, and only when it's absolutely necessary (spoiler: it won't be)
do you do the extra 80% of the work to squeeze out that last 20% of functionality.
