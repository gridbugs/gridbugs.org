I've started a git repo where I write down the definition of words that I encounter for the first time.
Almost every cryptic crossword I've solved (or attempted to solve!) has included a word which I'd not heard before,
and I've surely forgotten most of the new words I've discovered.
This will be an experiment to see if it helps me retain the words I learn from crosswords.
Repo is here: [github.com/gridbugs/words](https://github.com/gridbugs/words)
