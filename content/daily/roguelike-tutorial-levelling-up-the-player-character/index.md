I'm working on a series of roguelike tutorials as part of
[roguelikedev subreddit does the complete
roguelike tutorial](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series).
Today I updated the game so when the player descends to the next level of
the dungeon they are presented with a "level up" menu.
This required adding some stats like strength and intelligence.
For the first time the game feels like a real game.

I'll post the tutorial pages in a couple of days.
