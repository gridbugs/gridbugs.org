I updated all the posts on this site that previously linked to files.gridbugs.org or games.gridbugs.org
to point to [my itch.io page](https://gridbugs.itch.io/) instead. Some exceptions are works in progress,
and abandoned projects that I never plan to release, such as my [top down side-scrolling engine](https://games.gridbugs.org/abandoned-game-big/).
