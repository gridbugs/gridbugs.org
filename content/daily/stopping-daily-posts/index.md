After just over 100 daily posts, I'm going to relax the constraint that they be written each day.
I'm struggling to come up with interesting content, and writing daily posts is starting to feel like a chore.
I'll keep this area of the site as a place where I can write relatively low-effort, short posts, but I'll
only write them on days when I have something compelling to say.
