A partially-complete game engine I wrote in 2014 in javascript/html5.

[Demo (runs in browser)](https://games.gridbugs.org/top-down-sidescrolling-engine)

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

Features:

- circle/line-segment collision detection and processing
- framework for animating top-down 2D characters based on a skeleton description and a collection of images
- phong illumination in webgl
- dynamic lighting and visible area detection
