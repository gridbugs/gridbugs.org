This page will list pinouts of some electronic components I commonly find myself
using, as well as some notes on using them that might not be obvious from
reading the datasheets.

## 78L05 Voltage Regulator in TO-92 package

[Datasheet (pdf) for L78L series voltage regulators which includes the 78L05](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/l78l.pdf)

The 78L05 provides a regulated 5v supply on its output pin if sufficient voltage
(at least 7v) is supplied to its input.
If a device's documentation says that the device requires a regulated 5v power
supply, this is the kind of thing that it means.

The TO-92 package is commonly used for transistors but other 3-pin components
can also be found in this package.

The pinout in the datasheet is from the bottom-up point of view which I found
counterintuitive and possibly dangerous for people skimming the manual looking
for a pinout without reading the text indicating it's a bottom-up view.
In my experience, when a voltage source is connected to the output pin of 78L05
(ie. when it is connected backwards), the same voltage can be measured at its
input pin. It's not clear how much current it will allow to flow when connected
backwards but it's possible that this could damage whatever component is being
powered by the incorrectly connected 78L05.

![diagram of 78L05 in TO-92 package with pins labelled](78l05-to92.png)

The component has a round side and a flat side.
As shown in the image above, with the flat side facing you, with the pins
pointing downwards:
 - The _left_ pin is the _output_ and will provide 5v if sufficient voltage
   (at least 7v) is supplied to the input.
 - The _middle_ pin is _ground_.
 - The _right_ pin is the _input_.

The figure of 7v as the minimum input voltage is based on this image from the
manual:

![plot showing the relationship between input and output voltage](78l05-input-to-output.png)

So the actual minimum input voltage depends on how much current is being drawn
from the output, but if it's up to 100mA then 7v will be fine.

## LM358 and TL072 Dual Op Amps


[Datasheet (pdf) for LM385 Dual Op Amp (also contains information on related components)](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm358)

[Datasheet (pdf) for TL072 Dual Op Amp (also contains information on related components)](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl072.pdf)

Both components include a pair of op amps on a single chip and they have
identical pinouts. This is the pinout viewed from top-down:

![pinout of both op amps](dual-op-amp.png)

This table lists the pins corresponding to their arrangement in the diagram
above. The semi-circular indentation on the top of the IC is facing upwards.

| Left Side   | Right Side  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1OUT        | VCC+        |
| 1IN-        | 2OUT        |
| 1IN+        | 2IN-        |
| VCC-        | 2IN+        |

My mnemonic for this pinout is that the bottom left is usually ground and the
top right is usually positive voltage for ICs, and if you don't have a negative
supply voltage you'll probably connect the VCC- pin to ground. Then, a common
op amp feedback configuration is a voltage forwarder (aka. a buffer amplifier)
and in this configuration the IN- pin and the OUT pin are connected together. I
like to pretend that the designer wanted to make it easy to setup a voltage
forwarder by putting the OUT and IN- pins next to each other for both op amps on
the chip.

## TL074 Quad Op Amp

[Datasheet (pdf) for TL074 Quad Op Amp (also contains information on related components)](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl072.pdf)

This is 4 op-amps in a single chip. This is the pinout viewed top-down:

![pinout of tl074](tl074.png)

This table lists the pins corresponding to their arrangement in the diagram
above. The semi-circular indentation on the top of the IC is facing upwards.

| Left Side   | Right Side  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1OUT        | 4OUT        |
| 1IN-        | 4IN-        |
| 1IN+        | 4IN+        |
| VCC+        | VCC-        |
| 2IN+        | 3IN+        |
| 2IN-        | 3IN-        |
| 2OUT        | 3OUT        |

## MAX495 Op Amp

[Datasheet (pdf) for MAX495 Op Amp (also contains information on related components)](MAX49x.pdf)

This Op Amp is marketed as "Rail to Rail" which means its min and max outputs are close to the + and - supply voltages.

In the pinouts below I've added VCC- and VCC+ labels in addition to the VEE and VCC labels from the manual
for consistency with other component pinouts.

![pinout of max495](max495.png)

This table lists the pins corresponding to their arrangement in the diagram
above. The semi-circular indentation on the top of the IC is facing upwards.

| Left Side      | Right Side     |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| NULL           | N.C.           |
| IN1-           | VCC (ie. VCC+) |
| IN1+           | OUT            |
| VEE (ie. VCC-) | NULL           |

The inputs are numbered even though there is only one op-amp on the chip. The
output is not numbered in the manual but it could just as well be called OUT1.

The NULL pins are not the same as the N.C. (Not Connected) pin. The NULL pins
can be used to adjust something called "input offset voltage". There's more
info in the manual.

## Arduino Nano

[Datasheet (pdf) for Atmel Atmega328P (the microcontroller on the Arduino Nano](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf)

### Arduino Nano Pinout

This is the pinout of the Arduino Nano from the Arduino documentation, except
I've modified it to clarify that pins A6 and A7 can't be used as digital I/O
port pins.

![pinout of the arduino nano](arduino-nano.jpg)

Here's the pinout in tabular form. The positions of pins correspond to a
top-down view of the Arduino Nano with the usb port facing upwards. Each entry
is named after what is literally printed on the PCB next to each pin. In
parentheses after each name are the I/O port pin function (PXn) and the ADC
channel (ADCn) if any.

| Left Side      | Right Side  |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| D13 (PB5)      | D12 (PB4)   |
| 3V3            | D11 (PB3)   |
| REF            | D10 (PB2)   |
| A0 (PC0, ADC0) | D9 (PB1)    |

| A6 (ADC6)      | D3 (PD3)    |
| A7 (ADC7)      | D2 (PD2)    |
| 5V             | GND         |
| RST (PC6)      | RST (PC6)   |
| GND            | RX0 (PD0)   |
| VIN            | TX1 (PD1)   |

### Arduino Nano Power Supply

You can power the Arduino Nano by supplying between 7 and 12 volts to the VIN
pin, or by supplying regulated 5 volts to the 5V pin (such as with a 78L05
voltage regulator). When powering via the VIN pin, the 5V pin can be used as a
5V power supply for powering other components (including other Arduino Nanos, in
which case you would connect the 5V pin on one Arduino Nano to the 5V pin on
other other). This works because in between the VIN and 5V pins there is a 5v
voltage regulator similar to the 78L05 (but not identical - the Arduino Nano
uses a
[LM117IMPX-5.0](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117.pdf?ts=168433779491)).
It supplies the Arduino with regulated 5V but can supply other things too via
the 5V pin, because its output connects directly to this pin.

Some sources will recommend against supplying your own voltage regulator and
powering via the 5V pin and using the VIN pin instead. Indeed there is little point
using the 5V pin as the onboard voltage regulator should be just as good as
whatever you use instead to produce the regulated 5v. One reason you might do
this anyway is because the voltage regulator could wear out over time and it's
much cheaper to replace a voltage regulator than an entire Arduino. You could
wait until the onboard regulator fails before circumventing it with an external
component but this might be hard once the Arduino is soldered in place compared
to replacing the external voltage regulator with a new one.

### Arduino Digital Pins

The [Arduino Digital Pin documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins)
is a good starting point.

Some of the pins are multiplexed and have other functions that prevent them from
operating as digital IO pins, but by default all digital pins behave as IO pins.

There are 3 registers per IO port with a bit for each pin:
 - `DDx` (Data Direction) determines whether a pin is an input pin or an output
   pin. 0 = input, 1 = output. The default is all 0s (all input pins).
 - `PINx` can be read to determine the state of input pins.
 - `PORTx` can be written to set the state of output pins. Writing a 1 to a bit
   in this register corresponding to an input pin enables the pull-up resistor
   for that pin.

#### Arduino Switch Configurations

The main consideration when attaching buttons is not letting the input pin
"float"; the pin should always be connected to a voltage source or ground. This
is the purpose of "pull-up" and "pull-down" resistors. The resistor connects the
pin to the voltage source that will represent the "off" state (this could be
logic 1 or logic 0), and then when the button is pressed, the pin is connected
_directly_ to the voltage source representing "on".

Here is an example where the input pin sees 0v via the 10K pull-down resistor to
ground, but when the button is pressed the pin sees 5v.

![diagram showing an input pin with attached switch and 10K pull-down resistor](arduino-nano-pull-down-resistor.png)

Note that input pins have very high impedance, so they draw almost no current.
We don't have to worry about connecting a voltage source directly to the pin.

Here's another example where the input pin sees 5v via the 10K pull-up
resistor, but when the button is pressed the input pin sees 0v.

![diagram showing an input pin with attached switch and 10K pull-up resistor to 5v](arduino-nano-pull-up-resistor.png)

When the switch is open the pin sees (almost) the full 5 volts because the pin has
incredibly high impedance; it basically acts like an open circuit for the
purposes of calculating current and voltage drop.

This example shows how one could connect a switch with the Arduino's internal
pull-up resistor enabled (write a 1 to the PORTx bit for the input pin). The
following example is functionally equivalent to the previous example, but the
pull-up resistor is inside the Atmega328P chip on the Arduino.

![diagram showing an input pin with attached switch to ground with the pin configured to use the pin's internal pull-up resistor](arduino-nano-internal-pull-up-resistor.png)

When dealing with physical switches, one problem that can happen is "bouncing"
which is when the physical connection rapidly closes and opens for a brief
period after the switch is pressed. This can be solved in software by
introducing a short delay where the switch is ignored for a brief period after
its state changes, or it can be solved in hardware by adding a capacitor in
parallel with the switch. The charging and discharging of the capacitor smooths
out the rapid connecting and disconnecting, and the pin only sees the state
change after enough time has passed for the capacitor to charge or discharge
(depending on whether a pull-down or pull-up resistor is being used).

This example shows how to connect a capacitor to the internal pull-up resistor
example above, though the same technique can be used for all the examples.

![diagram showing an input pin with attached switch to ground with the pin configured to use the pin's internal pull-up resistor](arduino-nano-internal-pull-up-resistor-debounced.png)

#### Mixing Output Pin Values

This demonstrates a way of mixing the voltages at two output pins by connecting
them together through resistors to a common node. The diagram below shows two
pins connected in this way but it works for arbitrarily many pins. If the
resistors all have the same resistance then the common node will have a voltage
that is the mean of voltages at the output pins, but using different resistors
results in the weighted mean instead.

![diagram showing two output pins connected through resistors (labeled R1 and R2) to a common node M, with plots comparing the voltages at the pins and the voltage at the node M. Text says 'R1 = R2, Voltage at M is mean of output pin voltages'](arduino-output-pins-mean.png)

This works because unlike input pins which have very high impedance, _output_ pins have
very _low_ impedance (both when acting as current sources _and_ current sinks).
This means that they can produce relatively large amounts of current (the docs
say 40mA) and also they can consume a lot of current. This means that when an
output pin is producing logic 0 (0v), it serves a similar role to ground (it has
0v and it's a current sink). Thus we can analyse the circuit above as we would a
simple voltage divider. When one output is low and one output is high, then half
the high voltage is seen between the two resistors provided that they have the same resistance.

This idea can be extended to implement a digital to analog converter by
combining the voltages of many pins through carefully chosen resistances.

Note that as with naive voltage divider circuits (this is really just a naive
voltage divider circuit) the output of this circuit (the node with mixed voltage) has
high impedance (due to the resistors used). This means its voltage will rapidly
reduce as current is drawn through that node of the circuit.
One way to fix this problem is to
connect it to a voltage forwarder op-amp configuration:

![diagram showing two output pins connected through resistors (labeled R1 and R2) through a voltage forwarder to a common node M](arduino-output-pins-mean-voltage-forwarder.png)

Note that at this point we have almost implemented a non-inverting voltage adder (a common
op-amp configuration). All that's missing are resistors in the feedback network
to increase the gain of the op-amp to be equal to the number of pins being
combined. With a voltage forwarder the gain is 1 so its output is the (possibly
weighted) mean
of voltages rather than the (possibly weighted) sum of voltages.
