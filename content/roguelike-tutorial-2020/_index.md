In this tutorial series we'll implement a roguelike from scratch in rust
using the [chargrid](https://crates.io/crates/chargrid) library for
rendering and input handling. All the code is available on github: [chargrid-roguelike-tutorial-2020](https://github.com/gridbugs/chargrid-roguelike-tutorial-2020).
If you spot a bug in the tutorial, raise an issue or submit a pull request.
