A carbon tax. Electric cars.  
The climate changes less.  
We’ve done it folks. We’ve saved the world.  
Except for fish I guess.  
<!-- more -->

Should I ascend the ranks of wealth,  
And join the nouveau riche,  
I’ll miss nought from my former life,  
Except, I guess, for fish.  

In years to come, the food runs out,  
The world is on the brink.  
Eight billion screaming mouths to feed,  
And fish have gone extinct.
