Today I added a terrain generator for a forest biome, implemented the game's
basic systems, added a few hostile NPCs, a car inventory where items can be
exchanged with the player's inventory, and items for recovering health, energy,
food, and fuel.

I still need to add NPCs and items to the generated levels and add a win condition. I'll do both of those tomorrow.
