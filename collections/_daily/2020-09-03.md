For the past 10 years I've used a dvorak keyboard, but I'm currently trying to switch
back to qwerty. I switched to dvorak on a whim. I'm switching back to simplify my
software configuration, in particular, to remove the need to rebind vi-keys in all applications that
support them. It's not clear which keymap is superior. I have a sense that typing
on dvorak felt "smoother", but it's hard to be scientific about such evaluations.

One day in to using qwerty again, and thus far the experience has been humbling and
extremely frustrating!
