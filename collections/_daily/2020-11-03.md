title: Winit makes windows the wrong size in some cases I think

I want to find some time to debug a problem with [chargrid_graphical](https://crates.io/crates/chargrid_graphical)
where new windows spend a couple of frames at their specified size before shrinking. It seems related to hi-dpi
scaling. In particular, when a program starts, I observe the hi-dpi scaling factor starting as 1, then briefly changing
to 1.6667, then back to 1 again after several milliseconds. My hypothesis is that there is a race condition in
[winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) - the de-facto standard windows creation library for rust.
The scaling factor change from 1 to 1.6667 should have caused the window to get larger, but logging the size of the
window on each frame reveals that this never happens. The change from 1.6667 back to 1 does cause it to get smaller,
but it ends up 1/1.6667 of its original size. This suggests that winit is telling X11 (in my case) to resize the window,
and also querying X11 for windows sizes, and that there is a delay between telling X11 to resize and the change being
affected, during which X11 still reports the old size.
