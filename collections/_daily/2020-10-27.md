A while back I wrote about
{% local daily/formatting-guids-in-gpt-header-fields | the binary format of GUIDs in GPT headers %}.
Based on some examples I reverse-engineered conversion between a 128-bit integer on disk, and a UUID's
fields.

I've likely duplicated some logic from [winapi](https://crates.io/crates/winapi).
In the [uuid](https://crates.io/crates/uuid) crate, a feature can be enabled to include code
for converting UUIDs into GUIDs (defined in winapi), but it only works when the target
is windows (a requirement of winapi).
