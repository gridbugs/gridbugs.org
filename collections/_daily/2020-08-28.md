title: Planning to make a simple disk image creator
---

Several times in the past few weeks I've been frustrated by the lack of a tool
for generating a disk image containing a partition with a filesystem containing
a set of given files. Such a tool would be very useful in OS development.
Bootboot's `mkbootimg` tool, and grubs `grub-mkrescue` do something similar to
what I want, but there doesn't seem to be a "standard" way of doing this.
I want to spend some time this weekend working out whether it would be feasible
to make this tool myself.
