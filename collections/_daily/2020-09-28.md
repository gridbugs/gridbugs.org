I've started a git repository for storing my favourite cryptic crossword clues.
I try to solve at least one cryptic crossword per week, and I'd like to gradually
build up a list of the clues I find most entertaining, and instructions of how
to solve them. For now I'm storing clues and their solutions in a markdown file,
but I'll likely change this to a structured format like yaml or toml so I can
write simple queries later on. The repo is [here](https://github.com/gridbugs/cryptic-clues).
