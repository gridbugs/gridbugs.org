title: Chargrid HiDPI Scaling Fix
slug: chargrid-hidpi-scaling-fix
---

I spent some time over the weekend trying to reproduce a bug where
{% local daily/winit-makes-windows-the-wrong-size-in-some-cases-i-think | winit windows end up the wrong size due to rapid scaling factor changes %}.
Ultimately I couldn't reproduce the problem (but I'm keeping an eye out) but what I did learn is that when the
mouse cursor is on the hidpi monitor (I have two - one hidpi and one normal-dpi), and a windows opens on the non-hidip
monitor, it starts with the hidip scaling factor, but soon after starting its scaling factor changes back to 1.
I found that [chargrid_graphical](https://crates.io/crates/chargrid_graphical) wasn't handling the scaling factor change
(only the accompanying window size change), which caused graphics to appear blurry after the resize. It's now fixed.
