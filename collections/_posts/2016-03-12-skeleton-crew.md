I wrote this game for the 2016 7 Day Roguelike challenge.

Fight a variety of undead enemies with a variety of weapons on a procedurally
generated spaceship. Damaging the hull of the ship causes sections of the ship
to be depressurized, and their contents sucked into space, including you!

Play or download Skeleton Crew on [its itch.io page](https://gridbugs.itch.io/skeleton-crew).
