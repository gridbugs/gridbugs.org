I found a photo of you in my google drive.  
It's not a very good photo.  
I don't know very much about photography.  
I took the photo with my 6 year old phone,
which I stubbornly refused to upgrade  
even though it was painfully slow to use and the battery only lasted a few hours.  
The camera was slightly broken and everything in the photo is slightly out of focus.

I found a photo of you in my google drive.  
I took the photo 3, maybe 4 years ago.  
We were moving house.  
Moving overseas and selling all the stuff we didn't want to bring with us.  
Taking photos with my broken phone to post on facebook marketplace.  
In between photos of our TV and pieces of furniture,  
in a playful mood,  
I snapped a candid photo of you.  
You were sitting sideways on the couch, on your laptop.  
A look of concentration.

I found a photo of you in my google drive.  
I was scrolling through old photos,  
looking for an attractive photo of myself to upload to my dating profile.  
When I got to your photo, I paused.  
Just for a minute, maybe two.  
And smiled as I remembered the day we spent in the half boxed-up wreckage of our living room.  
I briefly thought about deleting the photo.  
It doesn't serve us to fixate on the past.  
In the end I decided to keep it,  
so that next time I find myself scrolling through the photos in my google drive,  
I can pause on the photo of you.  
For just a minute.  
And smile.
