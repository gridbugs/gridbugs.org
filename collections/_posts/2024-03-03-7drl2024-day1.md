It's the end of day 1 of 7DRL2024. So far I've got a level generator for an
area of ruined city and basic graphics and lighting:

{% image screenshot.png alt="Screenshot showing a pink street with some burning debris" %}

While working on this I fixed a very longstanding bug in my [lighting
system](https://crates.io/crates/visible_area_detection) that caused lights to
be too bright near their sources and to drop off with harsh steps rather than a
smooth gradient.
