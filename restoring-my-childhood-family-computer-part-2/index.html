<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/banner.jpg" alt="Close-up of the logo on the front of my Macintosh LC575" /></p>
<p>In <a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-1/">Part 1</a> I
inspected the motherboard and found what appears to be damage from a battery
acid leak.</p>
<p>Before I turn on my old Macintosh I want to take a look at its power supply in
case anything is obviously wrong with it. Step 1 was to remove the case which
was attached with T15 screws (step 0 was going and buying a T15 screwdriver).</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/unscrew.jpg" alt="A Macintosh LC575 with the screen facing down and a hand holding a screwdriver over one of the screws attaching the case to the front panel" /></p>
<p>The plastic was quite brittle and unfortunately one of the screw housings
snapped while I attempted to remove its screw. Also the screw on the bottom of
the case had a plastic shielding around it which made it hard to reach. I
recommend buying as thin of a T15 screwdriver as you can find if you attempt
this! Mine was too thick as it’s the kind of screwdriver with a bunch of
different removable heads. I ended up improvising and jamming a wad of paper in
between the end of the screwdriver body and the T15 head to extend its reach
which let me remove the screw.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks without its case. It’s a scary-looking high-voltage circuit
with giant capacitors, a glass tube which I assume houses the electron gun, and
giant coils of wire which I assume are electromagnets that aim the electron
beam.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/crt1.jpg" alt="The internals of the Macintosh LC575 including the CRT" /></p>
<p>The next part made me nervous. CRT monitors can build up a large static charge
over the course of their life and they can hold onto this charge for decades,
even when switched off and unplugged. Before poking around near the CRT I
needed to make sure this charge was removed. I watched a lot of videos of
people doing this before attempting it myself (and you should too - don’t just
copy what you read here!). The process was to attach an alligator clip between
a rubber-handled screwdriver and the case chassis, then poking the tip of the
screwdriver under the rubber suction cap and touching it against the wire
underneath. For extra safety I had one hand in my pocket the entire time so I
wouldn’t accidentally close a high-voltage circuit between my two hands.</p>
<p>If the CRT had been charged there would have been a loud pop as it discharged
into the chassis, but I heard no such pop. It’s possible that the decade or so
of disuse was long enough for it to fully discharge. Also apparently some Macs
from this era had “bleeder resistors” which allowed the CRT to discharge
safely. I’m certain I did the discharge procedure correctly so I assumed from
this point on there was no part of this circuit that was dangerous to touch.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/discharge.jpg" alt="A hand holding a screwdriver with an alligator clip attaching the screwdriver to the case chassis. The tip of thhe screwdriver is inserted into the suction cup covering the anode wire of the CRT." /></p>
<p>(I set up a stand for my phone and recorded a video of removing the case and
attempting to discharge the CRT just in case there was a cool spark or
something.)</p>
<p>I couldn’t see anything obviously wrong with the power supply circuit. I was
mostly looking for bulging or burst capacitors or burn marks. What I did find
an uncomfortable amount of though were wasp nests:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/wasps.jpg" alt="Potter wasp nests next to the CRT flyback transformer" /></p>
<p>The area I grew up had a large amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter_wasp">potter
wasps</a> that would lay their eggs in
these tubular mud nests. Fortunately the wasps were long gone but I still
needed to remove all the nests. They are made of mud and are quite delicate,
and if one breaks then there’ll be a bunch of dirt that I then have to clean
out of the power supply.</p>
<p>In the end I removed 4 clusters of nests and wasp egg shells from the machine. Gross.</p>

<p>I then gave the power supply and CRT a good dusting with some compressed air to
remove any dust and erm… wasp mud. Here’s a photo shoot of the internals of
the case:</p>

<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-2/flyback.jpg" alt="Close up of the CRT flyback transformer" /></p>
<p>Next step was to power it on and see if anything happens. I was
relieved to hear the nowadays somewhat unfamiliar sound of a CRT powering on, and no
magic smoke. There was nothing displayed on the screen and I couldn’t feel any
static when I put my hand close to the screen. Hopefully that’s just because
it’s not receiving any signal yet (I had the motherboard removed for this first
test).</p>
<p>Next up I tried adding the motherboard back in just in case its damage is
purely cosmetic. I also needed to attach the keyboard because that’s where the
power button is for some reason. Alas it did not power on when I pressed it,
which honestly is not surprising at all given the state of the motherboard, but
I was still a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>I’m betting that the motherboard is the main source of the problem. By which I
mean I’ve spent money on a replacement I found on ebay. When it arrives I’ll
post again about trying it out.</p>
<p>Part 3 is <a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/restoring-my-childhood-family-computer-part-3/">here</a>.</p>
