<div style="color:gray;font-style:italic">
<p>(Edit 2022-05-03: I found out that the Wave Function Collapse algorithm was heavily inspired by
an existing algorithm called “Model Synthesis”. I’ve added a <a href="#model-synthesis">section</a> to
further reading with links to the author’s website for more information.)</p>
</div>
<p>Wave Function Collapse is a procedural generation algorithm which produces
images by arranging a collection of tiles according to rules about which tiles
may be adjacent to each other tile, and relatively how frequently each tile should appear.
The algorithm maintains, for each pixel of the output image, a probability
distribution of the tiles which may be placed there. It repeatedly chooses a
pixel to “collapse” - choosing a tile to use for that pixel based on its
distribution. WFC gets its name from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse">quantum physics</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to build an intuition for how and why the WFC algorithm works.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I will break WFC into two separate algorithms and explain them separately. Each
is interesting in its own right, and the interface between them is simple.</p>
<h2 id="core-interface"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#core-interface" aria-label="Anchor link for: core-interface">Core Interface</a></h2>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#323232;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">fn </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#795da3;">wfc_core</span><span>(
</span><span>    adjacency_rules: AdjacencyRules,
</span><span>    frequency_rules: FrequencyHints,
</span><span>    output_size: (u32, u32),
</span><span>) -&gt; Grid2D&lt;TileIndex&gt; { </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">... </span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is the low-level part of the algorithm which solves the problem of
arranging tiles into a grid according to some specified rules. I’ll give a
“black box” description of the core here, and explain how it works internally
<a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/#core-internals">below</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adjacency-rules"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#adjacency-rules" aria-label="Anchor link for: adjacency-rules">Adjacency Rules</a></h3>
<p>The “core” receives a set of <strong>adjacency rules</strong> describing which tiles may
appear next to other tiles in each cardinal direction.  Some example rules are “Tile 6
may appear in the cell ABOVE a cell containing tile 4”, and “Tile 7 map appear in
the cell to the LEFT of a cell containing tile 3.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-hints"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#frequency-hints" aria-label="Anchor link for: frequency-hints">Frequency Hints</a></h3>
<p>It also receives a set of
<strong>frequency hints</strong>, which is a mapping from each tile to a number indicating
how frequently the tile should appear in the output, relative to other tiles.
If tile 4 maps to 6, and tile 5 maps to 2, then tile 4 should appear 3 times as
frequently than tile 5.</p>
<h3 id="tile-index"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#tile-index" aria-label="Anchor link for: tile-index">Tile Index</a></h3>
<p>The core doesn’t actually get to see the tiles
themselves.  Rather, tiles are referred to by integers ranging from 0 to the
number of tiles minus 1, which I’ll refer to as <strong>tile indices</strong>. The
<strong>adjacency rules</strong> and <strong>frequency hints</strong> are all specified in terms of
<strong>tile index</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="output"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#output" aria-label="Anchor link for: output">Output</a></h3>
<p>The algorithm
populates a grid with <strong>tile indices</strong> in a way which <em>completely</em> respects
<strong>adjacency rules</strong>, and <em>probabilistically</em> respects <strong>frequency hints</strong>.
Every pair of adjacent tiles will be explicitly allowed by the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>,
and the relative frequencies of tiles in the output will usually be about the same as
in the <strong>frequency hints</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="image-processor"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#image-processor" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-processor">Image Processor</a></h2>
<p>This is the “glue” between the core algorithm, and an input and output image.
Typically WFC is used to generate output images which are “similar” to input
images. There’s no requirement that the output image be the same dimensions
as the input image.
Specifically, similar means that for some <strong>tile size</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>every <strong>tile-sized</strong> square of pixels in the output image appears somewhere in the
input image</li>
<li>the relative frequencies of <strong>tile-sized</strong> squares of pixels in the output
image is roughly the same as in the input image</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the output image will have the same local features as the
input image, but the global structure may be different.</p>
<p>Note that there are some alternative applications of WFC besides generating
similar images, such as arranging hand-crafted tiles with user-specified
<strong>adjacency rules</strong> and <strong>frequency hints</strong>. These applications would still use
the same core algorithm, but the <strong>image processor</strong> would be different.</p>
<h3 id="pre-processing"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#pre-processing" aria-label="Anchor link for: pre-processing">Pre Processing</a></h3>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#323232;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">fn </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#795da3;">wfc_pre_process_image</span><span>(
</span><span>    input_image: Image,
</span><span>    tile_size: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">u32</span><span>,     </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#969896;">/* often 2 or 3 */
</span><span>) -&gt; (AdjacencyRules, FrequencyHints, HashMap&lt;TileIndex, Colour&gt;) { </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">... </span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The goal of this step is to generate <strong>adjacency rules</strong> and <strong>frequency hints</strong>
which will be passed as input to the core algorithm.</p>
<p>First, we need to know what the different tiles are.
Given an <strong>input image</strong> and <strong>tile size</strong>, enumerate all the <strong>tile-sized</strong>
squares of pixels from the <strong>input image</strong>, <em>including</em> those squares whose
top-left pixel occurs within <strong>tile size</strong> of the right and bottom edges,
wrapping around to the other side of the input image in such cases.</p>
<p>Consider this 4x4 pixel input image:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/process-example.png" alt="process-example.png" /></p>
<p>With a <strong>tile size</strong> of 3, the first 3 tiles created by looking at squares of
pixels with their top-left corners along the top row of pixels:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sample1.png" alt="sample1.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sample2.png" alt="sample2.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sample3.png" alt="sample3.png" /></p>
<p>In the 3rd tile, we sampled off the edge of the image. In such cases, wrap
around to the other side of the image. Effectively pretend that the image
repeats forever in all directions.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sample3-infinite.png" alt="sample3-infinite.png" /></p>
<p>Continuing in this fashion, enumerate all the tiles. In this example there are
16, and all are unique.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/all-tiles.png" alt="all-tiles.png" /></p>
<p>Assign each tile a <strong>tile index</strong>. In the example, we would use numbers from 0
to 15 as indices. <strong>Frequency hints</strong> and <strong>adjacency rules</strong> will be given in
terms of <strong>tile indices</strong>, rather than tiles themselves.</p>
<p>The next few sections will explain how to construct <strong>frequency hints</strong> and
<strong>adjacency rules</strong> so the core algorithm generates images which are similar to
the input.</p>
<p>Here’s an image which is similar to the example image, generated using WFC:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/grid-output.png" alt="grid-output.png" /></p>
<h4 id="reflection-and-rotation"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#reflection-and-rotation" aria-label="Anchor link for: reflection-and-rotation">Reflection and Rotation</a></h4>
<p>When generating tiles from an <strong>input image</strong>, you may want to include tiles which
aren’t necessarily present in the <strong>input image</strong>, but which are the rotation or
reflection of tiles from the <strong>input image</strong>.</p>
<p>We need a new example image to demonstrate this, as each rotation and reflection
of each tile is also in the tile set. Let’s use the following <strong>input image</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water-example.png" alt="water-example.png" /></p>
<p>With a <strong>tile size</strong> of 3, the top-left tile we extract will be:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water1.png" alt="water1.png" /></p>
<p>All rotations and reflections of this tile:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water1.png" alt="water1.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water2.png" alt="water2.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water3.png" alt="water3.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water4.png" alt="water4.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water5.png" alt="water5.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water6.png" alt="water6.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water7.png" alt="water7.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water8.png" alt="water8.png" /></p>
<p>Repeat this for all the tiles extracted from the image.</p>
<p>To include these tiles in the output, proceed with the rest of the algorithm as
normal, with these added to the tile set as fully qualified tiles, with their
own unique <strong>tile indices</strong>.</p>
<p>A similar image to the input <em>without</em> rotations or reflections included:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water-orig-orientation.png" alt="water-orig-orientation.png" /></p>
<p>Here’s an output with all rotations and reflections included:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/water-all-orientations.png" alt="water-all-orientations.png" /></p>
<p>The banner at the top of this page was generated from the following image including all
rotations and reflections:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/flowers.png" alt="flowers.png" /></p>
<p>Here’s a miniature version:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/small-flower-banner.png" alt="small-flower-banner.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that the ground is missing? Since the input image is wrapped, there are
no tiles in which the ground ends or changes direction. This means
that if the ground is present in the output, it must form a solid line from one
side of the output to the other. This is a fairly restrictive constraint, so in
<em>most</em> output, there is no ground at all. It’s possible for the output to deviate from the
<strong>frequency hints</strong> if the structure of the image means there is no way to place
a tile without violating the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a small chance of the output containing ground:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/ground-flower-banner1.png" alt="ground-flower-banner1.png" /></p>
<p>It’s not on the bottom of the screen, because the input image is wrapped.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/flower-tiled.png" alt="flower-tiled.png" /></p>
<p>Since this was generated with rotations and reflections included, there’s
nothing to stop the ground from being vertical.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/ground-flower-banner2.png" alt="ground-flower-banner2.png" /></p>
<h4 id="frequency-hints-1"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#frequency-hints-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: frequency-hints-1">Frequency Hints</a></h4>
<p>The number of occurrences of each tile in the input image is counted, and
mappings from a tile’s index to its count make up the <strong>frequency hints</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s modify the first example image:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tall-grid-input.png" alt="tall-grid-input.png" /></p>
<p>The set of unique 3x3 tiles in this <strong>input image</strong> will be the same as the
first example, however where in the first example each tile appeared exactly
once, here some patterns appear several times.</p>
<p>The following tiles appear 5 times in this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tile1.png" alt="tile1.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tile2.png" alt="tile2.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tile3.png" alt="tile3.png" />
<img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tile4.png" alt="tile4.png" /></p>
<p>The remaining tiles still just appear once.</p>
<p>The relative frequency the above 4 tiles will be 5, and the hint for the other
tiles will be 1. This means that the above 4 tiles are 5 times as likely to
appear in a given position as the other tiles.</p>
<p>How do you think this will change the output?</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/tall-grid.png" alt="tall-grid.png" /></p>
<p>Increasing the odds of vertical lines appearing means there will likely be more vertical
lines. This manifests as the grid cells in the image generally being taller than
they are wide.</p>
<h4 id="adjacency-rules-1"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#adjacency-rules-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: adjacency-rules-1">Adjacency Rules</a></h4>
<p>The core will produce a grid of <strong>tile indices</strong> where each index corresponds to a single pixel in
the output image.
For a given <strong>tile index</strong> in a cell of this grid, the output pixel
corresponding to the cell, will be given the colour of the tile corresponding to
the <strong>tile index</strong>.
Only the colour of the top-left pixel of the tile will be used.
Keep that in mind for this section:
<em>for every tile placed, only a <strong>single pixel</strong> of the tile (its top-left pixel) is
actually added to the output image.</em> As the core assigns pixel indices to grid
cells, we can say that the core assigns
the top-left corners of tiles to output image pixels.</p>
<p>Remember that the goal of the <strong>image processor</strong> is to produce an output image
where every <strong>tile-sized</strong> square of pixels occurs in the input image.
In order to meet this goal, we must ensure that whenever the core assigns the
top-left pixel of a tile to a pixel of the output image, the rest of the pixels
of the tile end up in the right places as well. This is best explained with an
example. Here’s a zoomed-in section of the banner:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/adjacent-example1.png" alt="adjacent-example1.png" /></p>
<p>Consider the 3x3 pixel square with a red border.
It occurs in the input image (rotated anticlockwise 90 degrees, below the
bottom-right flower).
Let’s assume it gets <strong>tile index</strong> 7.
The core algorithm decided that the grid cell corresponding to the top-left
pixel in the red square, should contain <strong>tile index</strong> 7.
Even though <strong>tile index</strong> 7 refers to the whole 3x3 tile (but only the <strong>image
processor</strong> knows this),
choosing <strong>tile index</strong> 7 for this cell resulted in only the top-left pixel of
the output image being populated.</p>
<p>But somehow the rest of the red square ended up looking like the tile with
<strong>tile index</strong> 7 as well. But why? Every time a <strong>tile index</strong> is assigned to a cell,
we want a way to make sure that the entire tile’s pixels - not just its top-left
pixel - end up in the right output pixels, relative to the tile’s placement.
Since each tile placement just contributes the tile’s top-left pixel, we need to
make sure that whenever a tile is placed within <strong>tile size</strong> pixels of an
already-placed tile’s top-left pixel, that the newly placed
tile’s pixels don’t conflict with the pixels of the already-placed tile.</p>
<p>A convenient fiction to help picture this, is to imagine that whenever
the core places a tile in a cell, each pixel in the <strong>tile-sized</strong> square of pixels whose top-left corner is that cell,
is coloured to match the corresponding pixel of the tile, but only the top-left cell
is marked as “populated”. Unpopulated (but possibly coloured) cells can have
tiles placed in them, <em>as long as all cells in the square filled by the new tile
are either not yet coloured, or contain the same colour as the corresponding pixel of the
new tile</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s generate <strong>adjacency rules</strong> to force the core to never place two tiles
in positions where their overlapping pixels conflict.
Recall that an <strong>adjacency rule</strong> is of the form: “<strong>Tile index</strong> <strong>A</strong> may appear in the
cell 1 space in <strong>DIRECTION</strong> from a cell containing <strong>tile index</strong> <strong>B</strong>”.
The rules should only permit <strong>A</strong> to be placed adjacent to <strong>B</strong> in
<strong>DIRECTION</strong> if doing so would not cause a conflict.
All non-conflicting
adjacencies should be allowed.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#323232;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">let mut</span><span> adjacency_rules </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#a71d5d;">= </span><span>AdjacencyRules::new();

</span><span>            }
</span><span>        }
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>compatible(a: Tile, b: Tile, direction: Direction) -&gt; bool</code> function returns true if and only if overlapping
<code>a</code> with <code>b</code>, if <code>b</code> is offset by 1 pixel in <code>direction</code>, the overlapping parts
of the two tiles are identical.</p>
<p>In the example below, <code>compatible(A, B, RIGHT) == true</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/compatible-example.png" alt="compatible-example.png" /></p>
<p>In this example tiles are 3x3, but these <strong>adjacency rules</strong> only ensure that
adjacent tiles are compatible. It’s possible for a pair of tiles which are 2
pixels apart to overlap. <strong>What prevents them from conflicting?</strong></p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/2-gap-overlap.png" alt="2-gap-overlap.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong><span style="color=red">red</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color=blue">blue</span></strong>  squares surround tile placements which are 2 pixels apart.
They aren’t adjacent, so the <strong>adjacency rules</strong> don’t explicitly forbid the <strong><span style="color=red">red</span></strong>
tile’s pixels and <strong><span style="color=blue">blue</span></strong>  tile’s pixels from being different in the intersecting
area.</p>
<p>However, the existence of the <strong>black</strong> square, which is adjacent to both the red
and blue squares, means that the red and blue tile placements won’t conflict.</p>
<p>Because they are adjacent, the <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/black</strong>
intersection and the
<strong><span style="color:blue">blue</span>/black</strong> intersection are conflict-free. That is, the colours of pixels in the intersecting
parts of the tiles are the same in both tiles.
<strong><span style="color:red">Red</span>/<span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> is contained in both <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/black</strong>
and <strong><span style="color:blue">blue</span>/black</strong>.
Since the pixel colours in the <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/<span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> region of <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong> are the same as the pixel colours
in the corresponding region of <strong>black</strong>, and the pixel colours in the <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/<span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> region of
<strong>black</strong> are the same as the pixel colours in the corresponding region of
<strong><span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong>,
the pixel colours in the <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/<span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> region of <strong><span style="color:red">red</span></strong> are the same is the pixel colours of the corresponding region of
<strong><span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong>. That is, <strong><span style="color:red">red</span>/<span style="color:blue">blue</span></strong> is conflict free.</p>
<h4 id="tile-colour-mappings"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#tile-colour-mappings" aria-label="Anchor link for: tile-colour-mappings">Tile/Colour Mappings</a></h4>
<p>After preprocessing, the <strong>frequency hints</strong> and <strong>adjacency rules</strong> will be passed to the core algorithm,
and it will return a grid of <strong>tile indices</strong>. To produce the output image, we will need to know which <strong>tile index</strong>
refers to which colour. To help with this, the preprocessor outputs a map from <strong>tile index</strong> to the colour
of the top-left pixel of the corresponding tile.</p>

<p>The final step is trivial. Take the grid of <strong>tile indices</strong> produced by running the core algorithm on the <strong>adjacency rules</strong> and
<strong>frequency hints</strong> from the preprocessor, and the top-left pixel colour map, also returned by the preprocessor,
and create an output image of the same dimensions as the grid.
For each <strong>tile index</strong> in the grid, set the corresponding pixel colour in the output image to be
the colour associated with that <strong>tile index</strong> in the top-left pixel colour map.</p>

<p>My goal for this section is to impart a deep understanding of how and <em>why</em> the core
algorithm works. This is the guide I wish I had during my implementation of WFC.
Maybe it can help you through yours!</p>
<h3 id="sudoku"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#sudoku" aria-label="Anchor link for: sudoku">Sudoku</a></h3>
<p>Imagine you’re solving a sudoku.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sudoku.png" alt="sudoku.png" /></p>
<p>Your goal is to place a number from 1-9 in each empty cell, such that each
row, column, and 3x3 square, contains each number from 1-9 exactly once.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re not super-confident in your sudoku-solving abilities, and your
pencil comes equipped with an eraser. You could cheat, by writing in each cell
(in tiny writing) all the possible values for that cell. Once all the cells are
enumerated in this fashion, hopefully there will be some cells with a single
possible value. For each of these cells, you erase the tiny pencil number, and
rewrite the number in permanent marker, “locking in” your solution for that
cell.</p>
<p>After locking in a cell, you want to update your enumerated possibilities for
other cells in the same row, column, and 3x3 square, erasing all instances of
the number you just locked in. You hope that by doing this, you’ll eliminate enough
possibilities that the next choice becomes obvious, and so on until you’ve
solved the entire sudoku in the least fun way possible! (This algorithm doesn’t
actually work in all cases, so you may occasionally have to employ some actual thought!)</p>
<p>Now, imagine you wanted to solve an empty sudoku in the same way as just
described:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/sudoku-empty.png" alt="sudoku-empty.png" /></p>
<p>Your goal is still to end up with the numbers from 1-9 in every row, column,
and 3x3, but this time you’re searching for one of a large number of possible
solutions. You start by writing in tiny pencil digits, the numbers from 1-9 in
each cell. Now you have a conundrum! Which cell do you lock in first? What
number to you write first?</p>
<p>Say you make your first choice arbitrarily, and write a big 3 in pen in the
top-left corner. Now you can propagate the effect of this choice by
scanning along the top-most row, left-most column, and
top-left 3x3 square, and erasing all the 3s.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>If you keep choosing arbitrarily, it’s very likely that at some point, you’ll
lock in a number, propagate the effect, and end up erasing the last
penciled-in
number in a cell. That would be bad, as then there would be no way to complete
the soduku!</p>
<p>Maybe you’re ok with screwing up occasionally, as long as there’s a reasonable
chance that you’ll end up with a valid solution each time. Then if you get into
a bad state (ie. a cell with no possibilities), you can just give up and start
over.</p>
<p>Intuitively, when choosing which cell to lock in next, you might want to always
choose the cell with the <em>fewest remaining possibilities</em>. If there are several
cells tied for the fewest remaining possibilities, choose arbitrarily between
them.</p>
<p>Concretely, your strategy is to repeat the following until all cells are locked
in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a cell at random, considering only the cells with the fewest possible values.</li>
<li>Choose a random value to lock in for that cell, considering only the possible
values for that cell.</li>
<li>Propagate the effects of locking in the cell, removing the locked-in value
from the possibilities of cells sharing the cell’s row, column, and 3x3
square.</li>
<li>If during propagation, you removed the final possibility of a cell, give up
and start again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core WFC algorithm looks very similar to this. In place of the rules of sudoku,
there are the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>. The <strong>frequency hints</strong> mean that when
choosing a value to lock in, you no longer make a uniformly random choice, but
instead choose from a <em>probability distribution</em> of the possible <strong>tile indices</strong>,
weighted by <strong>frequency hints</strong>. The fact that some tiles are more likely to
appear than others means the choice of which cell to lock in next is a little more complicated
than just choosing from the cells with the fewest possibilities. Finally,
we’re going to be more clever about propagation than in the sudoku example; you
don’t have to wait until a cell is locked in to eliminate possibilities from
surrounding cells.</p>

<p>Here’s a rough outline of the types and methods that the core will use.
I’ll fill in details as they become relevant. In the spirit of Wave Function
Collapse, “collapsing” a cell will refer to locking-in the choice of which tile
index will go in the cell.</p>

<p>In the sudoku example, we just chose randomly between the cells with the fewest
valid choices, to reduce the odds of removing all possibilities from a cell.
The intuition behind this is to lock in one of the cells with the
least uncertainty. In information theory, this uncertainty is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a>. The goal
of this step is to choose randomly between the cells whose entropy is lowest.
The <code>possible</code> field of <code>CoreCell</code> can tell us which tiles are allowed in a
given cell, and the <code>FrequencyHints</code> can tell us how likely a given tile is to
appear in any cell.</p>
<h4 id="entropy-primer"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#entropy-primer" aria-label="Anchor link for: entropy-primer">Entropy Primer</a></h4>
<p>If you have an unknown value with <code>n</code> possibilities: <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, …, <code>xn</code>,
and the probability of a given value x, represented as a number between 0 and 1, is expressed as <code>P(x)</code>, then the
entropy of your unknown value is:</p>
<p><code>- P(x1)*log(P(x1))  -  P(x2)*log(P(x2))  -  ...  -  P(xn)*log(P(xn))</code></p>
<p>…where the base of the logarithm is arbitrary. Let’s use 2 as our base.</p>
<p>To help build an intuition for this, first note that <code>P(x)</code> for all
possibilities will be between 0 and 1, and the sum:</p>
<p><code>P(x1) + P(x2) + ... + P(xn)</code></p>
<p>…is equal to 1. This is because <code>x1</code>…<code>xn</code> covers all possible outcomes, and one of the
outcomes will end up happening.</p>
<p>Each term in the entropy equation is negated. This is because <code>P(x)</code> is between
0 and 1, and regardless of the base, the logarithm of values between (exclusive)
0 and 1 is negative. Here’s a graph of log base 2:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/log2.png" alt="log2.png" /></p>
<p>Since each term contains <code>log(P(x))</code>, which is always negative, we negate each
term to make the resulting entropy positive, as otherwise it would always be
negative.</p>
<h4 id="a-special-case"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-special-case" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-special-case">A special case</a></h4>
<p>We can simplify the entropy equation for the purposes of this algorithm.</p>
<p>If you have an unknown value with <code>n</code> possibilities: <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, …, <code>xn</code>,
and each probability <code>P(x)</code> can be represented by <code>w1 / (w1 + w2 + ... + wn)</code>
(<code>w</code> stands for “weight”), then the above entropy equation can be simplified.
In practical terms, this is the case when you have a discrete probability
distribution - that is, you associate a weight <code>wk</code> with each possibility <code>xk</code>.
The probability of an outcome is its weight divided by the sum of all weights.</p>
<p>Let <code>W = w1 + w2 + ... + wn</code> be the sum of all weights.</p>
<p>Then the entropy of the unknown value is:</p>
<p><code>log(W)  -  (w1*log(w1)  +  w2*log(w2)  +  ...  +  wn*log(wn))  /  W</code></p>
<p>You can derive this equation from the original entropy equation and log
identities. It’s very satisfying. Try it!</p>

possible choices of tile.</p>

<p>The goal of this step is to choose randomly between the minimum entropy cells.
So far we can compute the entropy of a cell, but if there’s a tie, how do we
randomly break it. We <em>could</em> maintain a list of all the minimum entropy cells
and then choose randomly from it, but this sounds like a lot of work.
Instead, let’s
just added a small amount of noise to each entropy calculation! We can save
needing to invoke a random number generator for each entropy calculation by
pre-computing a noise value for each cell.</p>

<p>In the entropy calculation, just add <code>entropy_noise</code> to the previously

noisy, there won’t be any ties to break!</p>

<p>We can now compute a noisy entropy for each cell, so now we just need to iterate
over all the cells and keep track of the cell with the lowest entropy, right?</p>
<p>Well we <em>could</em>, but remember there’s one cell per output image pixel, and
200x200 pixel output images are not unheard of. Do we really want to iterate
over 40,000 cells at <em>every</em> step of the algorithm? The definition of
<code>CoreState::run</code> above invokes <code>choose_next_cell</code> once for each collapsed cell,
which is effectively once per cell again. 40,000x40,000 is not a nice number!</p>
<p>Rather than iterating over all the cells each time we need to choose the minimum
entropy cell, maintain a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a> of cells, keyed by
their entropy. Whenever the entropy of a cell changes, push it to the heap.
To find the minimum entropy cell, pop from the heap until you get a cell which
hasn’t been collapsed yet. If a cell’s entropy changes multiple times, you’ll
end up inserting it into the heap multiple times too. When popping from the
heap, you need a way of knowing whether each cell that you pop has been
collapsed yet so you can skip it.</p>

<h4 id="contradictions"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#contradictions" aria-label="Anchor link for: contradictions">Contradictions</a></h4>
<p>It’s possible to get into a state where a
cell has no possibilities remaining. I’ll call such a state a “contradiction”.
The point of choosing the minimum entropy
cell to collapse is to try to minimise this risk of contradiction, but sometimes
it happens anyway.
Certain sets of <strong>adjacency rules</strong> (ie. certain <strong>input images</strong>) increase the
risk of contradictions.</p>
<p>In practice, when a contradiction is reached, most implementations of WFC (including
mine) just give up and start again, maintaining a counter of times this has
happened, and stopping when it gets too high. Alternatives to this might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>saving checkpoints of the core state at various points throughout
generation, and rolling back to a previous checkpoint upon contradiction</li>
<li>making it possible to reverse the collapsing of a cell, making removed
possibilities possible again, so the cell with no choices of tile has some
choices again</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an interesting topic, but it’s out of scope for this post.</p>

<p>The previous section explained how to choose which cell to collapse next.
Now we need a way of choosing which tile to lock in. This method will select
randomly between all possible tiles for the chosen cell, assigning probabilities
based on <code>FrequencyHints</code>.</p>
<p>We’ll now choose from a probability distribution, where possible values are the
<strong>tile indices</strong> yielded by this iterator, and weights come from
<code>FrequencyHints::relative_frequency</code>.</p>
<p>Say for a given cell, the remaining possible <strong>tile indices</strong> are 2, 4, 7, and 8,
and their relative frequencies are indicated by the width of their section of
the strip below.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/probdist.png" alt="probdist.png" /></p>
<p>We want to choose a random position within this strip, and see which section we
ended up in. Naturally, we’re more likely to end up in one of the wider
sections.</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/probdist-choice.png" alt="probdist-choice.png" /></p>
<p>Here we landed on 7, so we lock in 7 for this cell.</p>
<p>Translating this diagram into code, we’ll choose a random number between <code>0</code> and
<code>cell.sum_of_possible_tile_weights</code> (introduced in the
<a href="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/#caching">Caching</a> section). This is analogous to choosing a random position within the
strip. To determine the tile index, we’ll decrease
the chosen number by each weight (the width of strips) until doing so would make
it negative.</p>

<p>Propagation enforces the <strong>adjacency rules</strong> by eliminating choices of tiles
from cells. If we propagate after every cell is collapsed, no matter which cell,
or possible tiles for the cell, are chosen, the resulting output of the core
algorithm will respect the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>.</p>
<p>Each time a tile is chosen for a cell, it’s likely that there will be fewer
choices of tile available to the surrounding cells. This is because of the
output must satisfy the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>. When a choice of tile is locked-in
for a cell, the <strong>adjacency rules</strong> tell us which tiles may be chosen for the
cells surrounding the locked-in cell.</p>
<h4 id="looking-beyond-immediate-neighbours"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#looking-beyond-immediate-neighbours" aria-label="Anchor link for: looking-beyond-immediate-neighbours">Looking beyond immediate neighbours</a></h4>
<p>In addition to updating the possibilities of cells adjacent to the collapsed
cell, we can often remove some tile choices from cells further away. The key
idea which this will rely on is:</p>
<p><em>If it’s possible to place a tile in a cell, then in each of that cell’s four immediate
neighbours, it must be possible to place a compatible tile, according to the
<strong>adjacency rules</strong>.</em></p>
<p>This is more applicable to propagation if we consider the contrapositive of this
statement:</p>
<p><em>For a given cell and tile, if in <strong>any</strong> of that cell’s immediate neighbours,
it’s not possible to place a compatible tile, then the original tile may not be placed in that cell.</em></p>
<p>As an example, let’s say the <strong>adjacency rules</strong> are:</p>
<ul>

<p>For completeness, assume that each rule above has a corresponding rule in the
opposite direction (e.g. the first would be “1 may appear to the LEFT of 2”).</p>
<p>Suppose the possibilities of cells are represented by the numbers in
corresponding cells of
this table, and we just locked in 1 in the top-left corner.</p>
<table style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
<tr><td style="background-color:#ffcccc"> 1 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td></tr>

<p>Propagating the effects to the immediate neighbours:</p>
<table style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">

<tr><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td></tr>
</table>
<p>But we’re not done yet. For example, what can we say about the middle cell?</p>
<table style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 2, 3 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td></tr>

<tr><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td><td> 1, 2, 3, 4 </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Can the middle cell contain a 4? It’s possible for a 2 to be in the cell to its
left, but it’s <strong>not</strong> possible for a 1 to be in the cell above it, so we can
remove the 4 from the middle cell.</p>
<table style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">

<p>Propagation continues in this fashion until no further possibilities can be
removed.</p>
<h4 id="tile-enablers"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#tile-enablers" aria-label="Anchor link for: tile-enablers">Tile Enablers</a></h4>
<p>For a given tile/cell combination, we’ll say that the possibility of another
tile in an adjacent cell <strong>enables</strong> the first tile tile to appear in the first
cell, if the adjacency of these 2 tiles would be allowed by the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>.
We’ll say that a potential tile in a cell is <strong>enabled</strong> in a direction, if the
immediate neighbour cell in that direction permits at least one tile which
<strong>enables</strong> the first tile. Note that a tile/cell may have multiple enablers in
a given direction. In the example above, the potential 3 in the middle cell is enabled in
the LEFT direction by the potential 2 and the potential 3 in the cell to its
left.</p>
<p>A tile may <strong>not</strong> be placed in a cell if it has 0 enablers in <strong>any</strong>
direction. That is, it needs at least 1 enabler in <strong>every</strong> direction to be
a candidate tile for the cell.
The potential 4 in the middle cell was <strong>not</strong> enabled by any potential
tiles in the cell above it, so the potential 4 was removed.</p>
<h4 id="cascading-removal"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#cascading-removal" aria-label="Anchor link for: cascading-removal">Cascading Removal</a></h4>
<p>If removing the possibility of a tile from a cell caused a potential tile in a
neighbouring cell to lose its last enabler, you must also remove the possibility
of that second tile from the neighbouring cell. This can cause a cascade in
which many potential tiles are removed from many cells in a single fell swoop.</p>
<p>To keep track of which tiles must be removed from which cells, whenever a
potential tile is removed from a cell, we’ll update a stack of removal updates.</p>

<p>The general strategy for propagation will be popping removal commands from
the stack, and checking if the potential tile was removed was
the final enabler for a potential tile in a neighbouring cell.
If it was, then remove that potential tile, and add a <code>RemovalUpdate</code> about the
newly-removed tile to the stack.
When the stack is empty, propagation is complete, and its
time to collapse the next cell.</p>
<p>After collapsing a cell, the stack of <code>RemovalUpdate</code>s will be populated with
updates about the removal of all but the locked-in tile. We can update the
<code>collapse_cell_at</code> function with this in mind (see below the <code>// NEW CODE</code>

<p>For a given <code>cell</code>, for a tile with index <code>A</code>, in direction <code>D</code>,
<code>cell.tile_enabler_counts[A].by_direction[D]</code> is the number of different

according to the <strong>adjacency rules</strong>, are permitted to appear adjacent to tile
<code>A</code> in direction <code>D</code>.</p>
<p>How should the counts be initialised?</p>
<p>First, observe each cell will start with an identical vector of
<code>TileEnablerCount</code>. As potential tiles are removed, the counts will change, but
they all start out the same.</p>
<p>As for the counts for each tile/direction combination, it should come as no

<p>Shameless plug!
My rust libraries which implement this algorithm are here: <a href="https://github.com/gridbugs/wfc">github.com/gridbugs/wfc</a></p>
<p>There are 2 crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/wfc">wfc</a> is the image processor and core, which
works with any grid of comparable values</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/wfc_image">wfc_image</a> is a wrapper of wfc
specifically for working with image files</li>
</ul>
<p>It also contains some example applications and interesting input images.</p>
<p>Of note is the <code>animate</code> example, which shows the process of generating the
image, representing uncollapsed pixels with the frequency-hint-weighted average
of colours of possible pixels. Visualising the possibilities for each cell, and
the order in which cells are collapsed can help get a better understanding of
WFC.</p>

</video>
<p>The <code>simple</code> example is also quite useful. It just generates images files based
on a specified image file. I used it for all the examples in this post.</p>
<h3 id="model-synthesis"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#model-synthesis" aria-label="Anchor link for: model-synthesis">Model Synthesis</a></h3>
<p>In 2007, Paul Merrell published an algorithm called “Model Synthesis” which uses
a constraint solver to generate textures from examples. The Wave Function Collapse
algorithm is heavily based on this work.</p>
<p>For more info, see <a href="https://paulmerrell.org/model-synthesis/">the description on Paul Merrell’s website</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/merrell42/model-synthesis">the source code for their implementation of Model Synthesis</a>,
and a <a href="https://twitter.com/exppad/status/1421058939274371079">thread on twitter comparing Model Synthesis to WFC</a>.</p>

<p>My inspiration to make this library, came from this repo:
<a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse</a>,
There are many great WFC resources listed in the <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse#notable-ports-forks-and-spinoffs">Notable ports, forks and
spinoffs</a>
section.</p>
<h3 id="fast-wfc"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#fast-wfc" aria-label="Anchor link for: fast-wfc">fast-wfc</a></h3>
<p>One such port is <a href="https://github.com/math-fehr/fast-wfc">fast-wfc</a>, which I
found to be particularly helpful as a reference for understanding how the
algorithm works. Most of my knowledge of WFC came from reverse
engineering this project.</p>

<p>While generating images for this post I accidentally ran WFC on this:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/all-tiles.png" alt="all-tiles.png" /></p>
<p>The output motivated me to add this outtakes section:</p>
<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/outtake1.png" alt="outtake1.png" /></p>
<p>The gaps between the tiles in the input were transparent, and in the output they
are black, which alerted me to the fact that the wfc_image crate currently
throws away transparency.</p>

<p><img src="https://gridbugs.github.io/gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/outtake2.png" alt="outtake2.png" /></p>
<p>I expected to see a roughly equal number of upwards sloping tiles and downwards
sloping tiles (as the input image is wrapped when sampling tiles):</p>
